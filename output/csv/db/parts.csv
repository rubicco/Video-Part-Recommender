Because it is much more expensive to produce beef without hormones. Consumer's buy with their eyes. Can't buy an orange that's unpeeled. JOANNE FARYON (Host): Hello everyone. I'm Joanne Faryon. Welcome to this Envision San Diego special ""Food."" It's something we take for granted. After all, California is the largest supplier of food for the country. Grocery store aisles are stocked with just about anything we care to buy. Chicken for less than a dollar a pound, steaks the size of a dinner plate, every species of fish and fruit and vegetables no matter the season. It may seem as though the cost of these groceries continue to rise, but we actually spend less money on our food then we did a couple generations ago. Just how all of this food makes its way to the grocery store and your dinner plate is the subject of tonight's investigation. We'll also tell you why it's relatively cheap to buy beef, chicken even fish. Some of it you may not want to know, but at the end of the program we hope you walk away a better informed consumer. 40 million pounds of San Diego oranges are on their way to countries as far away as China. 13,000 head of cattle are being fattened in Imperial Valley. One in five will be slaughtered for sale in Japan, the others distributed across the country. In Mission Bay, scientists are trying to figure out what to feed farmed fish. Those cattle you just saw, well, they could be on the menu. The food chain doesn't look like it use to. Fish no longer eat fish, cattle eat corn even though it can make them sick, chickens eat fish and fish are eating cows. Even chicken feathers become food. We grow oranges but send them away because they're too hard for us to peel; the ones we eat come from Australia. Just how did it get to be this way, and is it good for us?"

And how our demand for cheap food and more food has altered the food chain. A food chain that is motivated by making the greatest amount of food for the cheapest cost, in other words, efficiency. Americans consume nearly 20 percent of all the beef in the world but only make up about 5 percent of the world's population. In 2008, the U.S. slaughtered more than 34 million cattle, slightly more than the year before. So we followed the chain. And what we found was a fast-growing, corn-fed, hormone and antibiotic-injected animal that likely traveled thousands of miles before it ended up at your table. And most of the 1.4 million dairy cows are also destined for your table as hamburger. Let's start at the beginning. In southern California, most cattle start out like this, eating grass on a pasture. JIM DAVIS (President SD Imperial Valley Cattleman's Association): In the '40s and '50s when my grandfather was running cattle here he would basically sell his cattle as two or three-year-olds that would both be taken to market here in San Diego County and then distributed here in San Diego County. FARYON: It doesn't work that way anymore. Now, cattle are raised on grass for six months, then sold at auction to another rancher usually out of state. We don't have enough grass or rain to feed all our cattle year-round. Once they're sold they'll live another six months on grass. They'll be sold again. This time they go to a feedlot. Large pens where cattle are sent to be fattened before they're slaughtered. This one in Imperial Valley houses 13,000 animals. It's considered small. Some are home to more than 100,000 animals. Cattle spend four or five months here. They're fed mostly corn. The U.S. introduced cattle into feedlots and corn into their diets after World War II. Both had a dramatic effect. The animals grew faster and fatter. Broc Sandelin is an animal sciences professor at Cal Poly Pomona and a third generation cattle rancher. FARYON: Is there any research that says they have a tough time digesting corn? BROC SANDELIN: I'm not familiar with any I'm not a nutritionist so I don't really know for sure but I'm sure you could find something or I could find something for you. FARYON: Is it easier for them to digest grass rather then corn? SANDELIN: Yeah that's what they're naturally raised on is grass. FARYON: Studies have suggested corn-fed cattle may harbor more virulent strains of E. coli then grass fed beef, although a new study out of Kansas State University is now challenging that assertion. Feedlots have also led to wider use of antibiotics. And almost all the beef you buy in the grocery store comes from cattle injected with hormones. BILL BRANDENBERG: It is much more expensive to produce beef without hormones. FARYON: Corn makes cattle fat. Hormones give them more lean muscle tissue."

BRANDENBERG: And without hormones the cattle is going to have a lot more fat in them and they're going to produce a lot more of those upper grades of beef. FARYON: Don't they have more fat in them because we're feeding them corn? BRANDENBERG: It's a combination of the corn and the fact that what the hormones actually do, the animal produces different ratios of estrogen and testosterone. The hormone doesn't actually go into the bloodstream per se but it causes the animal to produce its own different level so it maximizes the production of lean and minimizes the production of fat. FARYON: But if we didn't feed them corn, isn't it the corn fed that give them the fat? BRANDENBERG: Yes. FARYON: So if we didn't feed them corn they wouldn't necessarily need the hormones to make less fat? BRANDENBERG: Well you could do them grass fed without implants,Â you'd have a product too"

That's what the consumer in the United States like is the flavor that goes along with tenderness that goes along with corn fed. FARYON: American beef is banned in Europe because of the use of hormones. Shelton Murinda is an animal sciences professor at Cal Poly Pomona. SHELTON MURINDA: The Europeans were using what I would call the precautionary principal which simply indicates when there is not enough scientific evidence it is better to be on the safe side. FARYON: Isn't it? MURINDA: It is always better to be on the safe side when you do not have sufficient scientific evidence. FARYON: Well then why do we still use hormones in beef in the United States? MURINDA:The situation is rather different here. There are pros and cons that have been thrown about. Some of them what I indicated: the potential side affects. From as far as I know, there has not been enough risk assessment that has been done"

MURINDA: We'd rather think differently here. We'd rather think differently. FARYON: So will any of these cattle end up on your plate? MURINDA: The chances of getting beef that's from California is rather slim in other words, most of it comes from outside California. FARYON: The average American eats about 17 pounds of fish per year. Half the fish we eat is farmed fish. That means the fish was born, raised and fed in a net not far off the coast. We wanted to know whether farmed fish was as healthy as wild-caught fish. The answer? It all depends on what farmed fish eat. And just wait until you hear what we're feeding them."

FARYON: Don Kent is President of Hubbs-Seaworld research Institute. Here they're developing new ways to farm fish, from the hatchery and now to your table. Hubbs-Seaworld wants to establish the largest fish farm off U.S. coastal waters five miles west of Mission Bay. Kent sees it as a boon to the local economy and a way to take pressure of depleting fish stocks. The debate over fish farming has traditionally been about how to do it in a way that doesn't contaminate local waters. Hubbs believes by establishing nets five miles off the coast where the water is deep and the current swift, it can minimize contamination concerns. But there's another issue. Fish also eat other fish. If farmed fish are fed fish, the practice could deplete dwindling stocks."

JEFFREY GRAHAM: For every pound of growth for a salmon it takes about five pounds of fish that are caught and ground up and turned into pellets or some kind of feeding mechanism to give to these fish. So five to one, that's a very stiff ratio. What you're essentially doing doing then is you're -- and part of the two-way street argument that's given about acqueculture is well, take pressure off the natural populations. However, if you have to catch five pounds of fish from the natural environment to rear one pound of salmon, for high-end table consumption the arithmetic doesn't work out in terms of the long-term benefits to the ocean. KENT: There's a lot of experimentation going on and we do it here on our species that's looking to replace that fish meal in the diet with soy protein or other processing byproducts like beef or chicken byproducts."

FARYON: According to the National Renderers Association cow and chicken by products, including cattle blood and bone, and poultry feathers, have been fed to farmed fish for decades. The association told KPBS cattle fat, blood and bone meal are being increasingly used in fish diets as an alternatives to fish oil and other proteins. So by now you might be asking what we asked when we learned fish were eating cattle by-products: Can fish get mad cow disease? Mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, is a neurodegenarative disease in cattle that can be passed onto humans. Eurpean countries have banned cattle by products in fish feed because if fish eat contaminated cattle and cattle eat contaminated fish, the disease in theory, can be transmitted to the food chain. Here in the U.S. the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of most cow by-products as feed to other cows in 1997. But the same rules do not apply to fish feed. However, a new regulation does ban the use of cattle brains and spines in fish feed; both contain the highest concentrations of infected material in diseased cattle. There has never been a case of humans contracting mad cow by eating farmed fish. Meanwhile, there continues to be an ongoing debate over the omega-3 content of farmed versus wild fish. Omega-3s are the healthy fats that can help prevent heart disease and Alzheimer's. One large grocery chain claims on its Web site, farmed salmon actually has more omega-3 than wild salmon. KPBS put their claim to the test and sent fish samples, wild and farmed, to a lab in Oregon. The tests results confirmed that farmed salmon did have nearly twice the amount of healthy omega-3s as wild salmon but you had to eat nearly four times the amount of fat to get those nutrients. Americans eat more chicken than any other meat, about 74 pounds per person each year, and most of it is white meat. Consumers like white meat and so the industry has found a way to give us what we want. CURTIS WOMACH: These are my fast-growing Cornish cross and they're what's in the supermarkets, all the restaurants sell this kind of chicken. FARYON: Most of the chickens we buy in a grocery store are called broilers -- a cross between two other chickens, a Cornish and Plymouth Rock. WOMACH: They're bred to grow really fast and have lots of white meat, see how wide it is, see the big breast? FARYON: But none of these chickens will end up in a grocery store. Curtis Womach raises these chickens on a farm just outside Julian. Most chickens in a grocery store are raised on a factory floor. Womach sells his chickens at a farmers market. He's decided he will no longer raise this type of chicken. WOMACH: Tthey can't physically mate because of the white meat gets in the way."

FARYON: The breasts are so big these chickens can barely walk. Look at these, a different breed and able to run away from our camera. Chickens are raised mostly on corn. Fish meal can be added to their feed -- even chicken feathers. Antibiotics are used, but it's illegal to use hormones in chickens in the U.S. So when you see labels like this, ""no hormones added,"" well, it's illegal to add hormones to all chicken. In fact, it's against USDA regulations to say no hormones have been added unless this line follows. See that line in small print? And ""natural""? Well, just about all the food you buy is natural unless something artificial has been injected. And ""fresh never been frozen""? The legal definition according to the USDA of fresh chicken means the internal temperature of the chicken has never been below 26 degrees farenheit. ""Free range""? It doesn't mean your chicken was raised like this. It means the chicken had access to the outdoors. But land to roam, time to grow, and feed like this -- organic fruit -- comes with a price. Womach's chickens cost about 20 dollars each compared to seven or eight dollars for a grocery store chicken. WOMACH: I think a lot of chicken is wasted. If you're paying 60 cents a pound what does it matter if you're not making stock from the bones but I think there is an American culture where it's like we deserve all the meat we want everyday. FARYON: Americans drink more orange juice than any other fruit juice. As KPBS reporter Amita Sharma tells us, orange groves are part of our history for the past 100 years. AMITA SHARMA: San Diego County groves produce 95,000 tons of oranges each year. Local growers are sending these oranges to India, China, Japan. All countries willing to pay premium rates for San Diego oranges viewed as some of the tastiest in the world. JOHN DEMSHKY: The color and taste of San Diego fruit is quite popular overseas so most of our San Diego fruit we actually send to a foreign country. SHARMA: Since we export most of our oranges, thousands of miles away as far as Japan, where do the oranges we eat come from? It turns out, depending on the season, the fruit we consume here is shipped from thousands of miles away from countries like Australia, South Africa and Peru. It is we, the consumer, who've determined that our oranges trot the globe. American shoppers like their oranges to be seedless and easy to peel. But San Diego oranges have seeds and their thinner skin is tougher to remove. We also like our oranges to be orange. DEMSHKY: Consumers buy with their eyes. You can't buy an orange that's unpeeled. But ultimately, that bright orange color is really a factor of the climate and temperatures they were grown in. But clearly your San Diego fruit might have had a little green on the top of it. It's something ""regreening"" in the industry. That's really just a cosmetic issue. It's not an indication of the flavor of the orange at all. SHARMA: In fact, says 79-year-old Ben Hillebrecht: HILLEBRECHT: They're sweet, juicy and just an excellent orange. SHARMA: Hillebrecht's family has grown oranges for generations in Escondido. HILLEBRECHT: All my life I've been right here. If I live until December, I'll be 80 years old. SHARMA: Hillebrecht would prefer to sell his fruit to San Diegans. HILLEBRECHT: But you can't make people eat them just because they're grown here. You buy them much cheaper from some place else. Food in America is cheap. You only spend 10 cents out of your dollar or 11 cents as an average American. SHARMA: But escalating water prices are making it difficult for orange farmers like Hillibrecht to keep on growing especially with oranges coming from Australia or Brazil. In fact, the Hillebrechts are turning off the tap on some of their orange trees because keeping them alive is no longer profitable. ERIC LARSON: Here in San Diego County, it's tough for farmers to compete. The land is expensive, labor is expensive, and water is very expensive because we import the water from a great distance so it makes a very, very difficult to compete. SHARMA: The Hillebrecht family has diversified what it grows and its fallback crop is San Diego top food crop. Last year the county produced 59,000 tons of this fruit. Forty percent of the avocados sold in the United States come from San Diego County groves like this one in Escondido. When avocados aren't in season here, chances are the ones you're buying in the store came from Mexico or Chile. MIKE HILLEBRECHT: In some ways that's beneficial because the consumer can buy avocadoes year around."

Local growers pay workers $8 an hour. In Mexico, workers earn $4 dollars a day. LARSON: Consumers really have a lot of control, it's just they just don't tend to exercise it. If the consumer truly wants to buy local fruits and vegetables -- number one farmer's markets -- you can't sell at a farmer's market unless you're a California grower or a San Diego County grower so right there, you know instantly, you're buying locally. If a farmer ships out of the area, it goes through an additional packing house, they're only going to get 19 cents of the food dollar. If it stays local and takes some of those middlemen out of the equation, they might be able to get a better price for the product they sell. FARYON: Tomatoes are the number one favorite fruit among Americans. As Reporter Ed Joyce tells us, San Diego County grow the nation's largest vine-ripened crop. ED JOYCE: San Diego County is home to the largest community of organic tomato growers in the state and nation, with 343 farms growing more than 150 crops. We wanted to find out what the difference was between organic and conventionally grown tomatoes. And whether the way they were grown affected taste. While tomatoes might be American's favorite, they're also the fruit we're least satisfied with when it comes to grocery store produce. So we went to the People's Organic Foods Market to talk with the coop's marketing director Amber McHale to find out why the store only buys and sells organic tomatoes. As a disclaimer, I'm a member of the coop. AMBER MCHALE: Some crops have been proven, organically, to have a higher yield, of certain vitamins, not all, that's a study that's still ongoing. But again, for me and for most of these shoppers it's not the extra-added nutrition,"

The EPA recently announced it will begin a series of tests on pesticides and their affects on human endocrine systems, which regulate growth, metabolism and reproduction. An environmental group in Washington D.C. ranked 43 fruits and vegetables based on the amount of pesticides, but not the toxicity of each pesticide, found on them. Â Tomatoes ranked halfway down the list with 47 percent of the tomatoes containing pesticide. Peaches were the worst offender, with 97 percent.

JOYCE: Casey Anderson is an organic grower. He and his mother grow 13 varieties of organic heirloom tomatoes in Valley Center. It's late in the season so Anderson's crop is winding down, but buying locally-grown organic tomatoes at a farmer's market is as direct and fresh as they come. But do they taste better?Â ANDERSON: They all have different tastes. I mean these, the green zebra's, these are um, this is fully ripe, this is what they look like, and they are really sweet, but they taste like they got lime drizzled over the top, they're really tangy. JOYCE: When it comes to flavor, it may just be matter of taste. However, most tomatoes bought in a grocery store have been picked when they're green so they can survive long trips across the country. They're ripened artificially with ethylene gas. Temperature also play a role. Tomatoes won't ripen in temperatures below 50 degrees. Some varieties are also bred for shape, color and shelf life -- not necessarily taste. In California, most tomatoes are destined for cans. The state produces 90 percent of the country's processed tomatoes. FARYON: Americans eat more per capita then ever before. And according to government statistics, one third of us are obese. We buy 99-cent hamburgers and chicken that costs less than a dollar a pound. Producers in the food chain tell us we want cheaper food and we want more of it. DAVIS: Obviously the consumer votes and tells you what's it's going to do. If you're raising something the consumer doesn't want and you don't sell it, you're not going to raise it again. So you will vote. FARYON: And we've voted with our money. We don't have enough time to peel our own oranges and we're too busy to find out what's in our food."

We're in a point where the economy is growing. We have very high corporate profits. We have a record stock market, and yet for decades now we've not been seeing significant wage increases for the American people. How have we gotten to a point where we can have high corporate profits, and businesses can be doing so well, but the workers don't necessarily share in that prosperity? Barack Obama: Well, this has been at least a three-decade-long trend. And this was a major topic in my State of the Union address. We obviously came in at a time of enormous crisis, and the first task was making sure we didn't have a complete global economic meltdown. The steps we took, whether making sure the financial system was functioning — saving the auto industry, encouraging state and local spending. All those things made a difference in buoying the economy, and then it’s been a hard but steady slog to the point where now we're growing at a robust pace and unemployment has come down faster than any time in the last 30 years. In some ways we're now back to the position where we can focus on what is this longer-term trend, and that is a larger and larger share of wealth and income going to the very top, and the middle class or folks trying to get into the middle class, feeling increasingly squeezed because their wages have stagnated. Now, there are a whole bunch of reasons for that. Some of it has to do with technology and entire job sectors being eliminated: travel agents, bank tellers, a lot of middle management, because of efficiencies with the internet and a paperless office. A lot of it has to do with globalization and the rest of the world catching up. Post-World War II, we just had some enormous structural advantages because our competitors had been devastated by war, and we had also made investments that put us ahead of the"

And around the ‘70s and ‘80s and then accelerating beyond that, those advantages went away at the same time as, because of technologies, companies are getting a lot more efficient and one last component of this is that workers increasingly had less leverage because of changes in labor laws and the ability for capital to move and labor not to move. You combine all that stuff and it’s put workers in a tougher position. So our job now is to create additional tools that, number one, make sure that everybody's got a baseline of support to be able to succeed in a constantly moving economy. Whether it’s healthcare that survives job loss, whether it is making sure we have child care that allows a two-working-household-family to prosper while still caring for their kids. Having a certain baseline in terms of wages, through the minimum wage. So that's one set of issues."

And how do they move up the value chain, essentially because they can work in higher-wage, higher-skill professions, and were able to compete for those jobs internationally? Then the third thing is making sure that we have an economy that's productive. Now if we do all those things, then what I'm confident about is that we can continue to lower the unemployment rate, increase the participation rate, and continue to grow and increase productivity. We're still going to have a broader, longer term, global question and that is: how do we make sure that the folks at the very top are doing enough of their fair share? The winner-take-all aspect of this modern economy means that you've got some people who just control enormous amounts of wealth. We don't really resent their success, on the other hand just as a practical matter, if we're going to pay for schools, roads, et cetera, and you've got you know, fifty people or eighty people having as much wealth as three billion, you know you're going to have problems making sure that we're investing enough in the common good to be able to move forward. So that's a long term question. But right now, there's some very specific things we can do that can makes a difference and help middle class families. And that's why I called it middle-class economics.  Ezra: To focus a bit on that long term question, does that put us in a place long term where redistribution becomes, in a sense, a positive good in and of itself, that you have an economy or potentially you have the government playing the role not of powering the growth engine which is what a lot of what had to be done after the financial crisis, but of making"

The fact of the matter is that relative to our post-war history, taxes now are not particularly high or particularly progressive compared to what they were, say, in the late ‘50s or the ‘60s. And there's always been this notion that for a country to thrive, there are some things, as Lincoln says, that we can do better together than we can do for ourselves. And whether that's building roads, or setting up effective power grids, or making sure that we've got high quality public education, that teachers are paid enough, the market will not cover those things.

If you had a corporate culture that felt a sense of place and commitment so that the CEO was in Pittsburgh or was in Detroit and felt obliged, partly because of social pressure but partly because they felt a real affinity toward the community, to re-invest in that community and to be seen as a good corporate citizen. Today what you have is quarterly earning reports, compensation levels for CEOs that are tied directly to those quarterly earnings, you've got international capital that is demanding maximizing short term profits.

Obviously the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, helps to cover the gap for those who aren't in that system. But for those of us who have an insurer, we don't track it.

There's certain areas like drugs where the fact that Congress has not been, and the Republican Party in particular, has been resistant to letting drug makers and Medicare negotiate for the lowest price. It results in us paying a lot more than we should. But if we're paying four, five, six, eight percent more than other countries for the same outcomes, I'd be pretty happy where we're only paying two or three percent more.

Obama: You know, I think that moving in the direction where consumers and others can have more power in the marketplace, particularly when it comes to drugs, makes a lot of sense. Now you'll hear from the drug companies that part of the reasons other countries pay less for drugs is they don't innovate. We essentially through our system, subsidize the innovation and other countries are free riders. There's probably a little bit of truth to that but when you look at the number of breakthrough drugs and the amount of money that drug companies now are putting into research and where they're putting it, a whole lot of it is actually in redesigning, modestly, existing drugs so"

That's not entirely true... but there's some of that. So there is a lot of savings that could be achieved while still making sure that our drug industry is the best in the world, and will still be making a healthy profit. Ezra: To turn a bit towards politics, at this point according to the polls, you are the most polarizing president really since we began polling, but before you the record was set by George W. Bush, and before George W. Bush the record was set by Bill Clinton. It seems that there's something structural happening there in terms party polarization and the way it affects approval ratings and cooperation with presidents. In your State of the Union you struck back at critics who say that the idea of healing some of these divisions is naïve or impossible. So when you welcome your successor into office, what would you tell them there is worth trying"

Obama: Well, there are a couple of things that in my mind, at least, contribute to our politics being more polarized than people actually are. And I think most people just sense this in their daily lives. Everybody's got a family member or a really good friend from high school who is on the complete opposite side of the political spectrum. And yet, we still love them, right? Everybody goes to a soccer game, or watching their kids, coaching, and they see parents who they think are wonderful people and then if they made a comment about politics suddenly they'd go, 'I can't believe you think that!' But a lot of it has to do with the fact that a) the balkanization of the media means that we just don't have a common place where we get common facts and a common world view the way we did twenty, thirty years ago. And that just keeps on accelerating, you know, and I'm not the first to observe this but"

But the point is that technology which brings the world to us also allows us to narrow our point of view. That's contributed to it. Gerrymandering contributes to it. There's no incentive for most members of congress, on the House side at least, in congressional districts, to even bother trying to appeal. And a lot of it has to do with just unlimited money. So people are absorbing an entirely different reality when it comes to politics, even though the way they're living their lives and interacting with each other isn't that polarizing. So my advice to a future president is increasingly try to bypass the traditional venues that create divisions and try to find new venues within this new media that are quirkier, less predictable. You know yesterday I did three interviews with YouTube stars that generally don't spend a lot of time talking about politics. And the reason we did it is because they're reaching viewers who don't want to be put in some particular camp, on the other hand when you talk to them very specifically about college costs or about health care or about any of the other things that touch on their individual lives, it turns out that you can probably build a pretty good consensus. Now that doesn't ignore the fact that I would love to see some constitutional process that would allow us to actually regulate campaign spending the way we used to, and maybe even improve it. I'd love to see changes at the state level that reduce political gerrymandering. So there's all kinds of structural things that I'd like to see that I think would improve this, but, you know there’ve been periods in the past where we've been pretty polarized. I think, there just wasn't polling around. As I recall there was a whole civil war, that was a good example of polarization that took place. Ezra: Do you think if we don't get some of those structural reforms, and more to the point if we continue along this path, in terms of where the parties are in Congress, are there ways to govern with polarization? It occurs to me that your argument when you came to office, but before you, Bush was a ""uniter not a divider"" and before him Clinton who was going to moderate and change the Democratic party with his sort of Third Way approach, the last couple of presidents have come to office promising the way they would get things done is to reduce polarization. Is there an argument or an approach that can be made to govern amidst polarization? Obama: A couple observations. Number one is that in American history, even during the so-called golden age where, you know, you had liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats and there was deal cutting going on in Congress. Generally speaking, big stuff didn't get done unless there was a major crisis or you had -- and/or you had big majorities of one party controlling the Congress and a president of the same party. I mean that's just been the history. There have been exceptions, but that's often been the case in terms of big muscle movements in the political system. And you know, my first two years in office when I had a Democratic majority and Democratic house and Democratic Senate, we were as productive as any time since Lyndon Johnson. And when the majority went away stuff got blocked. Probably the one thing that we could change without a constitutional amendment that would make a difference here would be the elimination of the routine use of the filibuster in the Senate. Because I think that does, in an era in which the parties are more polarized, it almost ensures greater gridlock and less clarity in terms of the positions of the parties. There's nothing in the constitution that requires it. The framers were pretty good about designing a house, a senate, two years versus six year terms, every state getting two senators. There were a whole bunch of things in there to assure that a majority didn't just run rampant. The filibuster in this modern age probably just torques it too far in the direction of a majority party not being able to govern effectively and move forward its platform. And i think that's an area where we can make some improvement. Ezra: One of the powerful things that's happened as polarization has increased politically is it's begun structuring people's other identities. The one I'm particularly interested in here is race. If you look back at polling around the OJ Simpson verdict or the Bernhard Goetz shooting in New York, Republicans and Democrats you basically couldn't tell them apart. Now you look at the Zimmerman verdict or you look at what's going on in Ferguson and opinion"

Do you worry about the merging of sort of racial and partisan identity? Obama: I don't worry about that because I don't think that's going to last. I worry very much about the immediate consequences of mistrust between police and minority communities. I think there are things we can do to train our police force and make sure that everybody is being treated fairly. And the task force that I assigned after the Ferguson and New York cases is intended to produce very specific tools for us to deal with it. But over the long term, I'm pretty optimistic and the reason is because this country just becomes more and more of a hodge-podge of folks. Again, this is an example where things seem very polarized at the national level and media spotlight, but you go into communities -- you know one of the great things about being president is you travel through the entire country and you go to Tennessee and it turns out that"

And you go to some little town in Iowa and you see some hasidic Jewish community, and then you see a bunch of interracial black and white couples running around with their kids. And this is in these little farm communities and you've got Latinos in the classroom when you visit the schools there. So people are getting more and more comfortable with the diversity of this country, much more sophisticated about both the cultural differences but more importantly the basic commonality that we have. And you know the key is to make sure that our politics and our politicians are tapping into that better set of impulses rather than our baser fears. And my gut tells me, and I've seen it in my own career and you see it generally, a politician who plays on those fears in America, I don't think is gonna over time get a lot of traction. Even, you know, it's not a perfect analogy but if you think about how rapidly the whole issue of the LGBT community and discrimination against gays and lesbians has shifted. The Republican party, even the most conservative, they have much less ability I think to express discriminatory views than they did even 10 years ago. And that's a source of optimism. It makes me hopeful. Ezra: On Obamacare, something that members of your administration have always said, and I think you may have said, there's been a lot of language about it being a good start, a platform to begin building. It's full of experiments, the idea is that there will be learning, and there will be change. It's been going -- now we're in the second year of open enrollment -- what would you like to see, if Congress were able to take up a bill, to tweak, to improve, to change, to build on that platform. What specifically from what you wanted in there originally or what we've learned since it's actually been in operation. How would you like to see it improved?"

All those things made a difference in buoying the economy, and then it’s been a hard but steady slog to the point where now we're growing at a robust pace and unemployment has come down faster than any time in the last 30 years. In some ways we're now back to the position where we can focus on what is this longer-term trend, and that is a larger and larger share of wealth and income going to the very top, and the middle class or folks trying to get into the middle class, feeling increasingly squeezed because their wages have stagnated. Now, there are a whole bunch of reasons for that. Some of it has to do with technology and entire job sectors being eliminated: travel agents, bank tellers, a lot of middle management, because of efficiencies with the internet and a paperless office. A lot of it has to do with globalization and the rest of the world catching up. Post-World War II, we just had some enormous structural advantages because our competitors"

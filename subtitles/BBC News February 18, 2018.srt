00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,080
welcome to bbc news, broadcasting to viewers
in north america and around the globe. my

1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,089
name is nkem ifejika. our top stories: tough
words for some us leaders. students from the

1
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:27,719
school targeted in a mass shooting demand
tighter gun controls. if all our government

1
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,983
and president can do is send "thoughts and
prayers," then it's time for victims to be

1
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:32,419
the change we need to see. president trump's
national security adviser accuses the syrian

1
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:38,469
government of using chemical weapons, and
demands action from global leaders. thousands

1
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:43,649
turn out to show their respects in zimbabwe
as the body of opposition leader morgan tsvangira

1
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,369
returns home. also in the programme: can you
see anything unusual about this picasso? we'll

1
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:58,849
uncover the mystery hiding behind the masterpiece.
hello.

1
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:15,689
i'm nkem ifejika, and this is bbc world news.
thousands of people in florida, including

1
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,289
survivors of wednesday's mass school shooting,
have taken part in a rally to demand tighter

1
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,219
gun controls in the united states. the event
took place outside the court building in the

1
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,500
city of fort lauderdale, a short distance
from the school where a former student, nikolas

1
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,590
cruz, killed seventeen people. laura westbrook
reports. chanting: no more! outside the federal

1
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,500
courthouse in fort lauderdale, this was the
message to lawmakers. among the protesters

1
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,890
was emma gonzales, who took cover on the floor
of her school's auditorium as a gunman started

1
00:01:51,890 --> 00:02:00,450
shooting. she had this to say to donald trump.
if the president wants to come up to me and

1
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,850
tell me to my face that it was a terrible
tragedy and how it should never have happened

1
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:10,280
and maintain telling us how nothing is going
to be done about it, i will happily ask him

1
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,500
how much money he received

1
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:18,009
from the national rifle association. what
she's referring to is the millions of dollars

1
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:23,818
the nra has given towards the trump campaign.
on a visit to the hospital where the victims

1
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:29,510
of the attack are being treated, the president
once again made no mention of guns or gun

1
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:38,370
control. instead, he says the problem is mental
illness. just a few kilometres south of where

1
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,310
the protest is being held, a gun show is taking
place. in the us, there are as many guns in

1
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,848
circulation as people. the nra is the most
powerful lobbying organisation in the united

1
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:57,068
states and they have successfully resisted
every move to tighten gun controls. and for

1
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:03,030
their supporters, it is a fundamental freedom.
when someone infringes a right for persons

1
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,939
in this country to keep and bear arms, then
it's

1
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,609
an infringement on rights and civil liberties.
that is a big problem. we will spend our times

1
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,810
at funerals... but after yet another school
shooting, anger among the younger generation

1
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,848
is rising. in fact, students across the country
are planning a mass walkout of schools in

1
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:30,219
april, the anniversary of the columbine high
school massacre. they are demanding adults

1
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:38,878
listen to them and tighten gun control. laura
westbrook, bbc news. in the last hour, president

1
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:45,068
trump issued a tweet on the fbi and its investigation
into the school shooting. he's suggested that

1
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:49,509
the fbi missed the signals that the florida
gunman, nikolas cruz, was planning a massacre

1
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:55,709
at his school because he said the agency is
spending too much time investigating his ties

1
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,019
to russia. he's tweeted that this was not

1
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:05,150
acceptable and the fbi needed to get back
to basics. president trump's national security

1
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,349
adviser has called on world leaders to hold
the syrian government to account for its continued

1
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:15,598
use of chemical weapons. speaking at the munich
security conference, hr mcmaster says it is

1
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,300
clear that such weapons are still being deployed.
tensions between moscow and washington have

1
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,400
also been evident at the conference. our chief
international correspondent, lyse doucet,

1
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:30,158
is in munich. it is not the first time that
senior us officials have accused president

1
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:35,468
assad's government and its main ally, russia,
are being behind the use of chemical weapons

1
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:41,180
in this area. we have recently a warning from
the french president, emmanuel macron, saying

1
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,088
there was evidence that they would strike
in retaliation to the use of chemical weapons.

1
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:52,009
it is not the first time. emmanuel macron,
in his case, so there was no proof what we

1
00:04:52,009 --> 00:05:01,550
have heard from hr mcmaster, he said thatjudging
by public records and by photographs, the

1
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:10,120
evidence is clear. he did not make clear which
public record or photographs he was referring

1
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,379
to. we do know that time and again, every
time this accusation is made,

1
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,569
the syrian government denies it and they have
responded when there was the warning from

1
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,300
emmanuel macron, faisal mekdad, the deputy
foreign minister, said that the syrian government

1
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:31,930
did not possess chemical weapons and he described
them as immoral. let's ta ke let's take a

1
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,559
look at some of the other stories making the
news. the israeli air force has carried out

1
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:41,099
raids in the gaza strip following an explosion
near the border in which four soldiers were

1
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:45,930
hurt. an israeli military spokesman said six
hamas military targets were hit, including

1
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,629
a tunnel. it's not known if there are any
casualties at this stage. around 100 neo-nazis

1
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:57,580
have held a torchlit march through the bulgarian
capital sofia, to honour a nationalist leader

1
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:02,269
who formed an alliance with the nazis during
the second world war. the event, held for

1
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:07,769
lieutenant-general hristo, lukov, went ahead
despite condemnation from the mayor and two

1
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:12,198
us congressmen. the march has been held annually
since 2003.

1
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:21,228
14 people have been killed, including a six-month-old
baby, when a mexican military helicopter,

1
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:25,908
carrying top officials surveying the damage
from an earthquake, crashed in a small town

1
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:32,829
in the southern state of oaxaca in mexico.
shuba krishnan has more. it was supposed to

1
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:40,560
be a military mission to assess damage and
provide support after a shocking 7.2 magnitude

1
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,930
quake. but it all went terribly wrong. the
helicopter carrying mexico's interior minister

1
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,168
and the 0axaca

1
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:54,628
state governor crashed on top of two minibuses
in a small village not far from the epicentre.

1
00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:01,970
14 people were killed including a six-month-old
baby. remarkably, senior officials on board

1
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,969
survived. the delegation had been touring
0axaca, the epicentre of friday's earthquake.

1
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:13,689
while no deaths have been reported from the
earthquake itself, it did leave nearlyi million

1
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:20,218
homes and businesses without power. witnesses
of the helicopter crash say it could have

1
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:26,538
been a power cuts that played a factor. they
say it circled several times, raising thick

1
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:34,308
clouds of dust and further reducing visibility.
translation: the entire town was without light,

1
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:39,030
it was dark. we were happy up there, we were
going to sleep up there, we were all going

1
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,688
to be up there but look what they did. the
governor was supposedly coming to help but

1
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:55,949
what was the help? the aid we received. this
was the aid? mexican politicians have apologised

1
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:02,369
for the accident but that won't do much to
ease the pain felt by relatives mourning the

1
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:09,729
loss of their loved ones. shuba krishnan,
bbc news. the body of zimbabwe's opposition

1
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:14,228
leader, morgan tsvangirai, has arrived back
in the country following his death from cancer

1
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:19,079
in south africa earlier this week. he was
65. hundreds of his supporters were at the

1
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,498
airport in harare to pay their respects. our
correspondent in harare is shingai nyoka.

1
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:31,080
he arrived at the airport where hundreds of
supporters were there to meet him. his body

1
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:37,879
was then escorted to the military barracks
where it will lie in state until tomorrow.

1
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:44,659
what we understand is that there will be a
church service at about 12 gmt tomorrow, followed

1
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:51,230
by a public service, a memorial service on
monday, and then finally his body will be

1
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,230
taken to his village, which is about four
hours outside the capital. he will be laid

1
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,509
to rest there. this is a state assisted funeral,
not a state funeral, in that case he would

1
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:09,689
have been buried at the national heroes acre.
the supporters were obviously very excited

1
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:16,680
to have his body back. they almost broke down
the hangar trying to get his body. but zimbabweans

1
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,679
have been

1
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:24,139
in a very sombre mood, remembering the legacy
that he had. he has been in politics here

1
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:29,370
in zimbabwe for about 20 years. he has led
the movement for democratic change for all

1
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:35,060
of that time. he is the figurehead for the
opposition and many people are wondering what

1
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:40,649
will happen to the opposition now that he
has passed away, given that in about four

1
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,559
months because time the country will be heading
for elections. it is a major departure from

1
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,509
what zimbabweans are used to. under president
robert mugabe, morgan tsvangirai served as

1
00:09:51,509 --> 00:10:00,450
his minister, but it was a very acrimonious
relationship between the parties. what we

1
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:08,700
have heard at the last few days from the president,
he described him as a son of the soil. they

1
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:17,150
said they might even consider conferring another
honour on him, the relationship between the

1
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:24,000
military and the party has always been tenuous.
they hailed him as a man who contributed to

1
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,940
democracy and pushed for free and fair elections
across the country. across-the-board, we have

1
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,940
seen

1
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,130
something that zimbabweans have never really
seen. that is all the political parties coming

1
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:42,259
together, putting their differences aside
to celebrate the life of morgan tsvangirai.

1
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,220
the british prime minister has called for
a new security treaty with the european union

1
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,210
after brexit, warning that lives could be
at risk without full co-operation. in a speech

1
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,990
in germany, theresa may said new arrangements
over working together should be effective

1
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,990
by next year. the president of the european
commission, jean claude juncker, agreed that

1
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,990
a post-brexit security alliance was necessary,
but said it should be negotiated separately

1
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,350
from other issues, such as trade. our political
correspondent, vicki young, reports from munich.

1
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,550
in defence and security of the uk

1
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:08,650
is a significant player. the prime minister
hopes that will get her a special deal. she

1
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,289
arrived in munich, keen to lay out britain's
contribution. generous spending on defence

1
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:21,279
and expertise it wants to share even after
brexit. theresa may urged the eu to take a

1
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:28,009
practical approach. this cannot be a time
when any of us allow competition between partners,

1
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:35,259
rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated
ideology to inhibit our cooperation and jeopardise

1
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:40,669
the security of our citizens. she's calling
for a new security treaty so that the close

1
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:45,819
partnership can continue. failure to agree
one would have damaging consequences, she

1
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,930
said. we must do whatever is most practical
and pragmatic in ensuring our collective security.

1
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:56,679
those who threaten our security would like
nothing more

1
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:04,649
than to see us fractured. some listening to
this were left bewildered. the brexit decision

1
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:13,220
from the point of view of us inside the eu
is extremely regrettable. things would be

1
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:23,210
so much easier if you stayed. so here comes
the questions. applause. mrs may pointed out

1
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:29,509
that brexit was a democratic decision politicians
should respect. one senior brussels figure

1
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:36,600
seemed to agree. the commission president,
jean-claudejunker, said the eu wasn't at war

1
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,029
with the uk and didn't want to take revenge
on the british people. he said the security

1
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:47,329
bridge would be maintained, but you couldn't
mix it up with other issues. conservative

1
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,850
mps attending the conference here believe
the speech is a good starting point for talks.

1
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,909
we've got to start getting into the detail
of this. i think one thing we can do is improve

1
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,379
our offer around defence and security, and
i do think we need to have another look in

1
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:05,590
the uk as to how we prioritise security. so
it's a pretty familiar message from theresa

1
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,759
may. the uk is leaving the european union
but that doesn't mean that close cooperation

1
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,580
needs to end. and it's a blunt message too,
saying to europe's leaders don't let your

1
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,050
ideology get in the wake

1
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:22,789
of the safety of our citizens. the government
hopes today's speech will show it's acting

1
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:30,349
responsibly, not wanting to drag the important
issue of security into fraught brexit negotiations.

1
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:43,909
vicki young, bbc news, munich. stay with us
on bbc news. still to come: she was famously

1
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:48,549
linked to an attack on a fellow skater. now,
the story of tonya harding gets the hollywood

1
00:13:48,549 --> 00:14:05,589
treatment. we speak to the film's stars. nine
years and 15,000 deaths after going into afghanistan,

1
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,790
the last soviet troops

1
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:12,299
were finally coming home. the withdrawal completed
in good order, but the army defeated in the

1
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,589
task it had been sent to perform. malcolm
was murdered. that has a terrible effect on

1
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:22,910
the morality of the people. i'm terrified
of the repercussions in the streets. one wonders

1
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:41,120
who is next. as the airlift got under way,
there was no letup in the eruption itself.

1
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,700
lava streams from a vent low in the crater
flowed down to the sea on the east of the

1
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,830
island - away from the town for the time being,
but it could start flowing again at any time.

1
00:14:50,830 --> 00:15:06,900
the russians heralded their new generation
space station with a spectacular night launch.

1

of the winter olympics in south korea are

1
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:36,250
under way with no medals up for grabs so far
but here's some of the highlights from day

eight. norway's marit bjorgen has skied her
way into the record books as part of the winning

1
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:46,219
team in the ladies four by five kilometre
cross country event. she is now the joint

1
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,110
most decorated winter olympian of all time
with 13 medals to her name. and great britain's

1
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,060
lizzy yarnold successfully defended her skeleton
title claiming gold ahead of team-mate laura

1
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:02,409
deas who got the bronze. which alongside a
bronze for izzy atkin in the ski slopestyle

1
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:06,949
event marked great britain's most successful
day at a winter olympics.

with the latest action - just go to the bbc

1
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:26,519
sport website. czech ester ledecka has caused
one of the biggest shocks in winter olympic

1
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,028
history. she swapped her snowboard for a pair
of borrowed skis and then beat the world's

1
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:36,350
best skiers to win the super-g. it's the first
alpine olympic gold medal for the czechs.

1
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:43,540
richard mcelvanney reports. ester ledecka
prefers to travel downhill by snowboard and

1
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,849
she is pretty useful on skis as well. not
a lwa ys pretty useful on skis as well. not

1
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:53,000
always corrode skis, though, she borrowed
these from giant slalom gold-medallist mikaela

1
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,690
shiffrin. faster than she has ever gone at
the super-g and faster than anyone else at

1
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,710
pyeongchang, taking it to one of

1
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:10,818
the most unexpected goals of the games. so
unexpected that the czech had to check if

1
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:17,749
she won. and no! what happened ? had to check
if she won. and no! what happened? what happened.

1
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:22,839
you tell me for that i really don't know what
happened. it was great. ester ledecka is due

1
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,470
to race in the snowboarding parallel slalom
next week and has to decide whether to ski

1
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,079
again in next week's downhill. her rivals
may help she chooses not to and mccullough

1
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,869
schiffer and may wa nt to and mccullough schiffer
and may want her skis back by then. -- mikaela

00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:44,729
shiffrin. while many eyes are focused on this
year's winter olympics, one of the most hotly-tipped

1
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,411
films for sunday night's british academy of
film and television awards is â€˜i, tonya,â€˜

1
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:56,119
based on events linked to the winter olympics
of 1994. it's a biopic about the american

1
00:17:56,118 --> 00:18:01,548
figure skater tonya harding, who became notorious
for her link to an attack on a fellow skater.

1
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:06,210
margot robbie plays the disgraced tonya, and
allisonjanney plays her mother - both have

1
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,350
received bafta nominations. our arts editor
will gompertz

1
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:14,199
has been to meet them. i was the best figure
skater in the world at one point in time.

1
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,179
4.8. how do i get a fair shot here? it wasn't
about telling the tonya harding story. the

1
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:28,798
haters always say, "tonya, tell the truth."
reporter: tonya, how do you feel. . . ? tyres

1
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:35,769
squeal. everyone has their own truth. there's
the whole, you know, conversation around truth.

1
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:41,509
we have all these unreliable narrators telling
completely contradictory versions of the exact

1
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:47,099
same event. i mean, come on! what kind of
frigginâ€˜ person bashes in theirfriend's

1
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:52,278
knee? who would do that? the juxtaposition
of everyone's different point of view and

1
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:58,839
story is where the dark comedy comes in, where
you see my character throw a knife at tonya

1
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:04,839
and then you cut to me saying, "you know,
what family doesn't have their ups and downs?"

1
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,259
i didn't stay home making apple brown betty's.

1
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:14,089
no. i made you a champion! knowing you'd hate
me for it! that's the sacrifice a mother makes!

1
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:21,439
i wish i had a mother like me instead of nice!
you cursed me. in the movie, you assault your

1
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,409
daughter on more than one occasion and yet,
her mother in real life denies it happening.

1
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:31,769
i told her side of the story very well. i
think i - i understood i had to make her a

1
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,809
three-dimensional character. she wasn'tjust
a monster. how old are you, honey? she's a

1
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:44,250
soft four. having been a figure skater myself,
i know how expensive it is to have custom

1
00:19:44,250 --> 00:20:11,099
skates and have the skating costumes. i know
what it took for my parents to get up at

1
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:17,819
in the business, do you think the game is
still rigged against women? there's far more

1
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,361
female-driven content, female-led films now
than even when i started - and i haven't even

1
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:27,350
been doing it this long. i think the next
step is having female storytellers tell those

1
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:31,118
stories and that's the change that i can see
happening right now. everyone is really making

1
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:36,058
a conscious effort and i think we will see
the, you know, the result of that over the

1
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:41,829
next couple of years. but still, is it enough?
no. we still have - the statistics are so

1
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:49,788
imbalanced, i think it's going to take a while.
but, yeah... new scanning technology has revealed

1
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:54,898
a painting underneath the famous picasso work
- "a crouching woman". the picture underneath,

1
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:59,349
is of the catalan landscape and is thought
to have been painted by a student. our science

1
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:05,808
correspondent pallab ghosh reports. picasso's
crouching woman - worth millions.

1
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:12,359
a painting from his blue period. but there's
more to it than meets the eye. the conservators

1
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,338
at the gallery analysed it with a new type
of scanner, and this is what they discovered

1
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:24,579
- underneath it is a painting of the barcelona
landscape by a fellow artist. but turn it

1
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:30,470
90 degrees and bring back the crouching woman
and you see that picasso has used the landscape

1
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,269
as the basis of his painting. it helps date
the painting. it helps determine where the

1
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:41,149
painting was made. but it also gives a sense
of the artist with whom a particular painter

1
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:48,128
was engaging. and i think these insights do
help ask us new and more interesting and more

1
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:53,618
scientifically accurate questions. the contour
of the hills in the background becomes the

1
00:21:53,618 --> 00:22:01,209
crouching woman's back, and she takes on the
shape and form of the catalan countryside.

1
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,440
until now, only the wealthiest galleries could
afford to scan, and even then, it was only

1
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,090
for great works of art. but the new system
is cheaper and portable, and so can be used

1
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,548
by anyone to find the secrets behind

1
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:20,619
any painting they want. the mexican muralist
artist... here at the harry ransom center,

1
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:26,479
the curator has questions about this portrait
of the american composer george gershwin - in

1
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,808
particular, whether a friend in the front
row was painted out and seated further back

1
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:36,700
because he fell out of favour. so, this figure
here is oscar levant, who was a friend of

1
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,028
george gershwin, but also a rival. and so,
stories have circulated for years that perhaps

1
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:47,940
he, as the only recognisable figure in the
second row, was perhaps moved - demoted, as

1
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,739
it were - from appearing in the first row.
so that's one of the questions that we can

1
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:57,880
potentially find out with this technology.
can i take a look? tracy has asked the team

1
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,030
that developed the scanning system to help
her answer that question. they scan each stroke

1
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:10,128
of the brush, millimetre by millimetre. it's
a collaboration that the team wants to extend

1
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:12,788
to more galleries. many of these paintings

1
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:17,170
are waiting to tell their secrets and so,
with the x-ray fluorescent spectrometer, we

1
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:24,149
can help them talk to us more. the team hopes
that the widespread use of their scanners

1
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:28,618
will increase our understanding of artists,
their thought processes, and the way they

1
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:42,599
worked. when kaya day searched for synonyms
for the word "feminine" on thesaurus.com,

1
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,019
she was so disappointed with the limited selection
that she wrote a letter of complaint. now

1
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:49,648
she says she's trying to get different words
added so that language can catch up with social

1
00:23:49,648 --> 00:25:54,319
consciousness about gender. antonyms include
rough and masculine. don't forget you can

1
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:08,939
get in touch with me and some of the team
on twitter, i'm @nkemifejika. hello there,

1
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
good morning.

1
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,259
it's going to be a bit chilly out there first
thing this morning. clearer skies in many

1
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:17,419
areas to follow the sunshine that we had yesterday.
but there won't be as much sunshine today

1
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:21,769
because all this cloud that has been filling
in the atlantic is going to be slowly heading

1
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:25,888
our way. and we've already seen some of that
cloud arriving across wales and the south-west,

1
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:31,298
so not as cold here. less reliable cloud elsewhere
means a touch of frost - especially for scotland

1
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,249
and down the eastern side of england, and
maybe some patches of fog too. we are going

1
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:39,970
to get some milder air eventually today - if
not today, then tomorrow. this envelope of

1
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,129
milder air coming in between these two weather
fronts here and it's this first one that we

1
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:48,378
need to look at for today because it will
eventually bring more rain and drizzle into

1
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:53,199
western areas. most places will start the
day dry. there may be some early sunshine

1
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,730
across some eastern parts of england. the
best of the sunshine probably for north-east

1
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,169
scotland. should be a lovely day here. a lot
more cloud spilling our way through the day

1
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:03,350
and especially in the afternoon, the cloud
thickening up to give some

1
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:07,648
more rain and drizzle, particularly across
northern ireland. but temperatures probably

1
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:11,609
around 10 or 11 degrees. ironically, where
it's going to be brighter, it's going to be

1
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:18,269
cooler towards the north-east of the uk. into
the evening and overnight, well, we find this

1
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:22,878
rain and drizzle continuing to push its way
eastwards pretty much across the country.

1
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:27,519
not much rain. there may well be some misty,
murky weather over the hills and a lot of

1
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,970
cloud overnight. so as a result, it's going
to be a much milder night, and temperatures

1
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:38,009
typically 5 or 6 degrees, so no frost early
on monday morning this time. instead, a different

1
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,749
look to the weather for eastern scotland down
the eastern side of england, where we are

1
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:46,740
going to have some misty, murky conditions
and some rain and drizzle. if there is any

1
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,128
sunshine, maybe some of these western coasts,
perhaps antrim and down, ahead of some more

1
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:55,538
rain coming in northern ireland later. but
a mild day - temperatures about 10, maybe

1
00:27:55,538 --> 00:28:01,829
as high as 12 degrees or so. but that mild
air getting squeezed away. colder air is going

1
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:06,158
to be spilling our way over the coming few
days - whether it comes in from the east or

1
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,870
from the west. and we start tuesday with some
thicker cloud,

1
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,349
some outbreaks of rain down the eastern side
of england, for a time in eastern scotland.

1
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:18,009
that rain tends to peter out, mind you. more
sunshine for northern ireland and for scotland,

1
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:22,019
perhaps some other western coasts of england
and wales, but already turning cooler out

1
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:25,569
towards the east underneath all that cloud.
and that's the way temperatures are going

1
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:29,628
to be going. it is going to be turning cooler.
high pressure building in over the uk - whether

1
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:34,139
it is this one from the atlantic or this one
from scandinavia, not a great deal of breeze

1
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,270
out there and where you have some breaks in
the cloud, there may well be some frost in

1
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:39,724
the outlook. after a mild start to the week
it will gradually turn a bit colder. the chance

1
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:39,738
of some of easterly winds, but it should be
turning dry.

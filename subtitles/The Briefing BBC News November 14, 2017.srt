1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:10,179
this is the briefing, i'm sally bundock.

1
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:15,940
our top story: thousands of iranians spend
a second night without shelter after sunday's

1
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:17,879
devastating earthquake.

1
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,278
the search for survivors continues.

1
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,908
anti-trump protestors clash with police in
the philippine capital, manila, on the last

1
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:32,350
day of the us president's tour of asia. and
the largest diamond ever put up for auction.

1
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,439
it could be yours forjust $30 million.

1
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,210
the art of the deal.

1
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,460
trump's team says the us has struck $300 billion
worth of trade and investment deals during

1
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,109
his asian trip.

1
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:50,159
we investigate.

1
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,689
in business briefing, i will be talking to
an international business guru to find out

1
00:00:53,689 --> 00:01:05,439
the real benefit to business from trump's
trip.

1
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:15,938
a warm welcome to the programme,

1
00:01:15,938 --> 00:01:22,589
briefing you on all you need to know in global
news, business, and sport. and it is a debate

1
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,290
about the king of sports that is raging on
social media, after italy failed to qualify

1
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,149
for the world cup for the first time in 60
years.

1
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:40,629
la gazzetta dello sport is asking, what should
italian football fans do now in june 2018?

1
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:41,849
send in your ideas.

1
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:55,379
just use the hashtag #bbcthebriefing.

1
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:00,179
thousands of survivors of a powerful earthquake
that struck the mountainous border region

1
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,020
between iran and iraq have spent a second
night without shelter.

1
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:10,030
the country is observing a day of national
mourning for the more than 400 people who

1
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,030
were killed

1
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:19,610
when the 7.3-magnitude quake struck near the
iran-iraq border, just under 30km south of

1
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,850
the city of halabja.

1
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,969
sarah corker reports.

1
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,449
this is the deadliest earthquake in the world
this year.

1
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:38,109
the border town here in western iran bore
the brunt of it.

1
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,780
homes were flattened in seconds, crushing
everyone inside.

1
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,530
the search for survivors has been frantic,
early this morning, iranian officials called

1
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,349
off the rescue operation.

1
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:57,229
at this local hospital, many of the injured
had stories of narrow escapes.

1
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:00,509
translation: i fell from the balcony down.

1
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,789
the earthquake was very strong.

1
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:07,049
translation: the earthquake shattered the
window, which fell on me, and it wounded my

1
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,540
hand and my face.

1
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:13,699
this mountainous area is prone to earthquakes.

1
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:18,030
power cuts and landslides have made it difficult
for rescue teams to get in.

1
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,870
the most severely hurt have been airlifted
out, some taken to hospital in the iranian

1
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,289
capital, tehran.

1
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,620
but, overwhelmed by the sheer number of injured,
the authorities are appealing for people to

1
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,770
donate blood.

1
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:40,400
and this is the moment this 7.3 magnitude
quake hit in neighbouring iraq. a man runs

1
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,879
for his life from the control room of this
dam. boulders were tossed around like pebbles,

1
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:50,680
and with cracks appearing in the structure,
there are now concerns about the safety of

1
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,163
the dam. translation: when the quake started,
rocks from the mountains started, rocks from

1
00:03:57,163 --> 00:04:00,140
the mountains started falling on the street,
and damaged cars.

1
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,500
it even cause damage

1
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,090
to the walls of the dam. a picture of widespread
devastation is emerging.

1
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,909
hundreds dead, thousands injured, many missing.

1
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:20,620
turkey has sent a convoy of aid trucks, medication,
10th and blankets, and many have spent a second

1
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,899
night outdoors, terrified by the after-shocks.

1
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:31,219
so far there have been more than 190 of them
-- tents. and we have more detail on that

1
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:42,240
story on our website, and we will discuss
it later in the programme.

1
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,259
theresa may has launched her strongest attack
yet on russia.

1
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:52,840
speaking at the lord mayor's banquet in london,
the british prime minister said russia must

1
00:04:52,839 --> 00:05:00,029
choose a very different path from the one
that had seen moscow annex crimea, foment

1
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:09,549
conflict in ukraine, and launch cyber attacks
on governments and parliaments across europe.

1
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,918
russia has fomented conflict in the donbass,
repeatedly violated

1
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,959
the national airspace of several european
countries, and mounted a sustained campaign

1
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,489
of cyber espionage and disruption.

1
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,819
this has included meddling in elections, and
hacking the danish ministry of defence and

1
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:32,740
the bundestag, among many others.

1
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,019
it is seeking to weaponise information, deploying
its state-run media organisations to plant

1
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:45,068
fake stories and photoshopped images, in an
attempt to sow discord in the west and undermine

1
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,669
our institutions.

1
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:53,198
so i have a very simple message for russia.
we know what you are doing, and you will not

1
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,819
succeed.

1
00:05:54,819 --> 00:06:00,379
because you underestimate the resilience of
our democracies, the enduring attraction of

1
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:06,280
free and open societies, and the commitment
of western nations to the alliances that bind

1
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,718
us.

1
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:09,718
protesters have marched

1
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:13,829
towards the presidential palace in manila,
as leaders gathered for the second day of

1
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:14,829
the asean summit.

1
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:19,189
it is the final day of president trump's mammoth
tour of asian countries.

1
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:24,579
it began 11 days ago with him touching down
in japan, and before the day is out, he will

1
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:30,560
be back in washington, dc. howard johnsonjoins
us from the philippinesâ€™ capital, manila.

1
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,899
howard, it is quite a big day, as president
trump heads back to the united states.

1
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,668
what is on the agenda, what will dominate
today?

1
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:45,459
well, what dominates today happens in about
half an hour in a building behind me.

1
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:49,978
it is the east asia summit, it is the showpiece
of the 50th anniversary asean summit that

1
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:51,218
we are attending here.

1
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:54,560
what it is is it isa we are attending here.

1
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,430
what it is is it is a grouping of regional
leaders who will be discussing with dialogue

1
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,240
partners like the united states and

1
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,290
japan, they will talk about issues about regional
security here.

1
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:11,419
so donald trump will be there to hear concerns
about islamic state in southeast asia. he

1
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:15,019
will also hear about north korea's missile
threats.

1
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,455
but the biggest issue that always comes up
but the biggest issue that always comes up

1
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:23,110
at these summits is the south china sea, so
they will be talking about how can they come

1
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:29,330
together to agree a code of conduct that can
decide how they manage these waterways? we

1
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:33,508
can see trillions of dollars worth of trade
passed through these waters every year, and

1
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,000
america is keen to reassert its influence
in this area, as china builds up sandbags

1
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,249
and islands over the last year while the leaders
in this region have tried to work out this

1
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,249
code of conduct.

1
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:51,460
quite interesting, on that issue with the
philippines, being a bit softer towards china,

1
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,258
it would seem, this time around, under president
duterte.

1
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:03,490
yes, what we have seen is, in the previous
administration,

1
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:10,699
there was an effort to try to reassert filipino
influence in this story.

1
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,471
what they did was they took this case to the
international arbitration court, and they

1
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:20,728
won this case, saying that china could not
lay claim to that area.

1
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:27,370
since president duterte came to power, he
hasn't really acted on this, and he hasn't

1
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,190
really acted on this, and he has tried to
really curry favour with china. he has been

1
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,250
softer on the approach, and his foreign minister
even said that they won't really looking for

1
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,379
a legally binding code of conduct this afternoon,
but rather a gentleman's agreement, that they

1
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:50,389
could all somehow muddle through this without
a legal document to really attack it down.

1
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,600
0k, document to really attack it down.

1
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,610
ok, for now, howard johnson in manila, thank
you.

1
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,830
let's brief you on some of the other stories
making the news: there have been further calls

1
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:04,590
by us republicans for the party's alabama
senate candidate, roy moore, to stand down,

1
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:11,840
following a wave of allegations of sexual
misconduct by him against teenage girls decades

1
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
ago.

1
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,120
a fifth woman has come forward and said he
groped her when she was 16.

1
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,159
mr moore has denied all the accusations against
him.

1
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:34,189
protesters have interrupted a pro-fossil fuel
presentation by white house advisers by breaking

1
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,190
into song.

1
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,940
the us officials were promoting wider use
of fossilfuels on the sidelines of a un climate

1
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,440
conference in germany.

1
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,930
they say what is known as clean coal must
be part of the solution to global warming.

1
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:51,519
international creditors holding $60 million
of creditors' -- $60 billion of them is whetherâ€™s

1
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,419
bonds have said

1
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:59,789
no deal has been made.

1
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:06,990
their economic situation is blamed on economic
situation is blamed on economic sabotage by

1
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:13,509
the united states.

1
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:21,000
the white house is touting the rather whopping
figure of $300 billion in deals during the

1
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,220
president's swing through asia. the lion's
share of that, $250 billion, came during his

1
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,629
trip to china.

1
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:34,649
liam booth-smith, chief executive of localis,
an independent think tank, joins me now.

1
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,799
i will be speaking to you a little later in
the news briefing.

1
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,159
but first, let's talk about donald trump's
asia trip, and the deals he struck while there.

1
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:47,439
when you dig a bit deeper, it is not quite
as cut and dry as that, is it? know, and president

1
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,810
trump drawing a long line in recent history
of leaders who have gone to china and come

1
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:58,159
back, trumping, as it were, their economic
success and the deals they have signed.

1
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,159
what is

1
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:05,819
interesting about this is that rex tillerson
has said, and i quote, the deals are pretty

1
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
small.

1
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,080
a lot of it is stuff that is always the being
announced, some of it is deals where there

1
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:18,550
is no firm commitment, just a promise -- already
being announced.

1
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:26,439
it is very much in line with the trump economic
policy, and there is also a deal where china

1
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,010
will now have access to the us domestic energy
supply.

1
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,110
general electric, is that the one with general
electric?

1
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,460
that's quite true, yes.

1
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,740
it is interesting, isn't it? because there
has been an opening up of the market in both

1
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,529
directions, it seems, which is helpful to
the united states and china.

1
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,221
what about other countries? we are still to
hear from the philippines if anything was

1
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:53,980
struck that, but deals have been done with
japan, south korea, for example.

1
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
still relatively small.

1
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,430
what has happened in the summit at the moment
is that deals for the us outside of

1
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:05,269
china appeared to be relatively small, and
the discussions from trump, what has come

1
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:07,970
out of his camp, seems to be largely about
security.

1
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,790
and that contrasts very interestingly with
the very hard economic position they are taking

1
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:13,829
with china.

1
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,110
thank you very much indeed.

1
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:24,039
liam is going to get a strong coffee, he is
looking at some of the other stories today.

1
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:29,089
join our conversation regarding the football
world cup.

1
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:35,941
italy did not qualify, so we are asking along
with the italian press what italian fans should

1
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:37,600
be doing injune next year.

1
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,730
so far, many of your comments i cannot say
on the television.

1
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,960
0ne viewer says enjoy the world cup with no
tension.

1
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,410
that is her advice.

1
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:54,469
stay with us on the briefing. also on the
programme: italy fails to qualify for the

1
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,050
world cup, for the first time in 60 years.

1
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:04,120
that and more in the sport briefing.

1
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:11,710
berliners from both east and west linked hands
and danced

1
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,230
round their liberated territory.

1
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,139
and, with nobody to stop them, it wasn't long
before the first attempts were made to destroy

1
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,250
the structure itself.

1
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,529
it's keeping the candidate's name always in
the public eye that counts.

1
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:30,610
success or failure depends not only on public
display but on the local campaign headquarters

1
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,620
and the heavy routine work of their women
volunteers.

1
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,039
yasser arafat, who dominated the palestinian
cause for so long, has died.

1
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,839
the palestinian authority has declared a state
of mourning for the leader who symbolised

1
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,180
his people's hopes for independent statehood.
in the wake of the colombian volcano disaster,

1
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,689
rescue teams are trying to reach thousands
of survivors who managed to clamber onto rooftops

1
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:58,620
and trees above the sea of mud. after 17 years
of discussion, the result was greeted with

1
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,850
an outburst ofjoy.

1
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,930
women ministers who'd long felt only grudgingly
accepted amongst the ranks of clergy suddenly

1
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:14,879
felt welcomed.

1
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,100
you're watching the briefing.

1
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,990
0ur headlines: thousands of iranians have
spent a second night without shelter - after

1
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,169
sunday's devastating earthquake.

1
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:26,949
tehran has declared a national day of mourning.

1
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,440
anti-trump protestors have clashed with police
in the philippine capital manila - on the

1
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,360
last day of the us president's tour of asia.
here's our briefing on some of the key events

1
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,490
happening later.

1
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:45,360
let's start off with a bang in california,
where nasa will launch a cutting-edge environmental

1
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,340
satellite at 9.117 on the dot, gmt time.

1
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,030
the shoebox size machine will provide advanced
tracking of weather events during its 10-year

1
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,029
orbit.

1
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:02,829
later on in london, a brexit milestone will
be made when mps debate the eu withdrawal

1
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,520
bill as it begins its committee stage in the
commons.

1
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,199
the talks also mark exactly 500 days before
the uk's scheduled departure

1
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,990
from the eu. and in the afternoon, attorney
generaljeff sessions testifies before the

1
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,600
housejudiciary committee in washington.

1
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:31,750
he's likely to be pressed over his "inconsistencies"
on the trump campaign's russia connections.

1
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:37,980
in the uk, members of parliament will today
begin debating a key piece of brexit legislation,

1
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,840
it the eu withdraw bill.

1
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,850
that will turn european laws into uk ones
opponents including rebels from the ruling

1
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,980
conservative party have tabled scores of amendments.

1
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,810
0ur correspondent reports.

1
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:03,939
is still the one in charge, theresa may last
night at the glittering

1
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,970
lord mayor â€˜s banquet in london.

1
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,970
a breakfrom lord mayor â€˜s banquet in london.

1
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,610
a break from wrecks it and potential trouble
ahead.

1
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,310
a key piece of the government's brexit legislation
returns to the commons today.

1
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,409
and mps are trying to tinker with there.

1
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:22,589
they are proposing hundreds of changes to
try to influence the approach of ministers.

1
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,071
and so yesterday, an apparent concession to
one of their key demands.

1
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:27,080
yesterday, an apparent concession to one of
their key demandslj yesterday, an apparent

1
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
concession to one of their key demands.

1
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,810
i can now confirm that once we have reached
an agreement, we will bring forward a specific

1
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,549
piece of legislation to implement the agreement.

1
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:40,629
parliament will be given time to debate, suit
grew tonight and vote on this final at deal.

1
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,159
it will only hold if parliament approves it.

1
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:50,809
but was such a fragile majority, only a handful
of tory backbenchers siding with the opposition

1
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,000
would lead to a defeat for the government.

1
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,240
and those in mind to rebel seem unsatisfied
with the take it or leave it vote the government

1
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
has offered.

1
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,269
the take it or leave it vote the government
has offeredlj the take it or leave it vote

1
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,269
the government has offered.

1
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,509
i must say, many of us insulted by this.

1
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:04,509
they

1
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:09,230
sounded so good and then when you dug into
the detail you realise that this is meaningful

1
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,838
vote was meaning less.

1
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,609
there will be more contentious votes here
in the coming weeks as mps votes here in the

1
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:21,548
coming weeks as m ps test votes here in the
coming weeks as mps test the government's

1
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,529
fragile working majority.

1
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:28,839
now with news about italy's failure to reach
next year's world cup finals and the rest

1
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,639
of today's sport briefing here's tulsen tollett.

1
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,470
hello i'm tulsen tollett - here's what's coming
up in your sport briefing this tuesday.

1
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,319
it's crunch time for denmark and the republic
of ireland as they bid to book their place

1
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,179
in russia 2018.

1
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,230
but there's no place for italy after losing
out to swden in their play-off, while roger

1
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:57,370
federer continues his bid to win a seventh
atp tour finals title there are nowjust three

1
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,969
spots left at the russia world cup next year.

1
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,730
one of those will go to either the republic
of ireland or denmark later on tuesday night.

1
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,749
the second leg of their playoff is in dublin,
with honours even after a goalless draw in

1
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:09,749
copenhagen.

1
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:13,740
denmark had the better of the chances in the
first leg, while ireland were criticised for

1
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,200
a lack of creativity.

1
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,999
you have to try and cover all eventualities
but it only takes a second to score a goal,

1
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:30,288
so the minute a goal is scored in the game,
that eradicates a lot of things, it eradicates

1
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:39,519
extra time, it eradicates penalty kicks and
things like that we may need a couple of goals

1
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,720
to keep out denmark for two games might be
tough.

1
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,870
there are a number of international friendlies
around the world on tuesday. one of those

1
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,599
is england against brazil.

1
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,719
brazil were the first team to qualify for
the russia world cup way back in march.

1
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,110
with the likes of neymar and coutinho in their
squad, england boss gareth southgate says

1
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:02,248
they're "the best team in the world", but
he won't be afraid of picking a young team

1
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:04,600
to face them.

1
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:11,069
now, in case you missed it, italy won't be
playing at next

1
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:15,759
year's world cup in russia. it's the first
time since 1958 the azzurri have missed out

1
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,140
on the sports showpiece event after losing
out on aggregate to sweden in their two legged

1
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
qualifier.

1
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,150
the second leg in milan finished goalless
despite the best efforts of the hosts to manufacture

1
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,970
a goal meaning the 1-0 win for the swedes
in stockholm last week proved the difference

1
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,899
while the italian manager gian piero ventura
who has only been in charge for 17 months

1
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:36,768
will now come under serious presssure.

1
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:41,378
rafael nadal is out of the season-ending atp
world tour finals.

1
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:44,949
the spaniard withdrew with a knee injury after
losing his opening match to belgium's david

1
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,679
goffin in a tough three set match that took
more than two and a half hours to complete

1
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,330
against the 26-year-old, meaning nadalâ€™s
fellow spaniard pablo carreno busta comes

1
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,048
in as the alternate for the next two matches.

1
00:19:57,048 --> 00:20:01,720
now, cyclist chris froome has won the tour
de france four times but he's still hungry

1
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,440
for more! at 32 the british rider says he's
still excited by the prospect of racing and

1
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
he's hungry

1
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
for a fifth tour title.

1
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
it's a good question.

1
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,808
i definitely don't feel as if i'm there yet.

1
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:15,089
i guess i'll know when the time is right.

1
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:20,678
but for the time being i'm still hungry, still
motivated to keep trying to win another tour

1
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,369
de france and i'm just going to take it one
year at a time.

1
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:35,778
so long as the body's able to do this then
i'm going to keep going.

1
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:40,038
four-time champions italy failed to reach
the world cup for the first time since 1958

1
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,200
after a play-off defeat against sweden.

1
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,278
there's been plenty of reaction on social
media.

1
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:48,159
the gazetta dello sport doesn't mince its
words.

1
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,870
this was their headline not long after the
match finished, saying that it's an apocalypse.

1
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:58,558
zlatan ibrahimovic, the former sweden international
and now manchester united player recovering

1
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:06,148
from injury posted a picture of the team saying
"we are zweden" while the official italy twitter

1
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:11,890
account tweeted a quote from gigi buffon saying
"blame is shared equallly

1
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:12,891
between everyone.

1
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:14,048
there can't be scapegoats.

1
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:16,470
win together, lose together.

1
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,038
you can get all the latest sports news at
our website - that's bbc.com/sport.

1
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:26,990
but for now from me, tulsen tollett, that's
your sport briefing.

1
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,919
many of you have not been so diplomatic when
it comes to the outcome of the game with italy.

1
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,580
basically we have a lot of advice for italian
football fans about what they should do injune

1
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:37,579
of next year.

1
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:42,349
peter yates from england suggest that they
support england instead.

1
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:47,879
a woman from vancouver suggests pastor.

1
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:58,528
-- pasta. and a man from australia suggest
that they practise football and not diving.

1
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:08,470
there's more than a little sparkle brightening
up the november gloom in geneva this week.

1
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,190
some of the world's rarest and most valuable
gemstones are up for auction, they all command

1
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,259
multi million dollar price tags, but there
is one particular diamond which is attracting

1
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:20,028
special attention - and it goes under the
hammer tonight.

1
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:23,440
imogen foulkes has been along to have a look.

1
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,269
there is more than a little sparkle in geneva
this dull november.

1
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:36,778
every year the jewellery houses compete to
show that one special stone the rarest, the

1
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:37,778
purest, the most vivid.

1
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:41,970
but this year there is one extraordinary showstopper.

1
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:50,679
that is 163 carats. this is the largest diamond
ever to be put up for auction.

1
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,389
to show it at its best, or maybe to make sure
potential buyers don't mistake it for an ice

1
00:22:56,388 --> 00:23:01,079
cube, it has been set into a string of emeralds.

1
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,839
59119 of them.

1
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,199
add to that,

1
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,038
862 diamonds on the other side and this piece
makes all sorts of records.

1
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,609
but there is one especially important number
everybody wants to know.

1
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:20,859
how much? we expect to in the region of $30
million for it.

1
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:26,758
it is the largest flawless diamond ever to
come to market.

1
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,450
finest colour, finest clarity and extraordinary
proportions.

1
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:37,080
there is a temptation with a diamond crystal
to cut the largest possible and end up with

1
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,960
a stone that is possibly lopsided or lumpy,
just to keep the weight.

1
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,110
not here.

1
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,918
this is perfection.

1
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,028
the diamond is brand-new.

1
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:48,869
0nly mind last year.

1
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:51,908
but history is going under the hammer in geneva
as well.

1
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,340
this 19 ca rat hammer in geneva as well.

1
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:59,379
this 19 carat diamond graced the grounds of
french kings for 350 years.

1
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,409
pink.

1
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:01,429
yellow.

1
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,528
necklace, ring or brooch,

1
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,099
jewellery lovers are spoilt for choice.

1
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:14,839
but while many will look, with his multi-
million-dollar pricetag is, only a few will

1
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,178
be able to purchase.

1
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:28,979
stay with me on bbc news, i'll be back with

1
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,798

1
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,940
the italy did not qualify for the world cup
next year in russia.

1
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,669
many of you had sent in your thoughts and
ideas.

1
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:49,549
many have been suggesting that they just enjoy
the world cup for a change without all the

1
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,548
stress.

1
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,548
there is a thought.

1
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:53,250
i will see you inafew there is a thought.

1
00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:03,220
i will see you in a few minutes.

1
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,980
hi there.

1
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,669
yesterday was a pretty chilly day, with temperatures
between five and seven celsius.

1
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:14,769
it was even cold enough for a bit of snow
in scotland.

1
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,519
i know many of us go nuts for snow, but these
scenes are likely to be short-lived, because

1
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,839
the air is going to be turning a little bit
milder today.

1
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,529
the cold weather we had yesterday was due
to these northerly winds moving down across

1
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:29,118
the uk. but we've had a change of wind direction
over the last 12 hours orso, dragging in much

1
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:30,118
milder conditions.

1
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:33,278
a weak weather front lying across central
portions of the uk will thicken the cloud

1
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,839
up, to bring us some spots of light rain or
drizzle.

1
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:43,658
so today it will be cloudy and it will also
be a mild today as the wind changes direction.

1
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,369
here is the forecast.

1
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:49,339
first thing in the morning, these are the
temperatures if you step outside early.

1
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:54,778
patches of rain around in northern scotland
where it may also be cold enough for pockets

1
00:26:54,778 --> 00:27:02,739
of frost. for england and wales, a cloud to
start the day really temperatures will range

1
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:03,739
from

1
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:05,220
7- 12 really temperatures will range from
7- 12 degrees.

1
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,579
the cloud will bring is patches of rain across
wales.

1
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:12,579
parts of the midlands, east anglia and north-west
england also looked down.

1
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:16,808
it will be cloudy in northern ireland but
in scotland the weather is quite different.

1
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:21,298
a few showers in the far north but otherwise
a fine and crisp, sunny start to the day.

1
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:24,819
a bit of frost perhaps across the sheltered
northern areas.

1
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:30,308
in the rest of the day the sunniest weather
will remain in scotland.

1
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:34,749
northern ireland most of england and wales
are struggling to see much in the way of brightness.

1
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:39,249
the cloud continues to fit into an occasional
patch of rain but the temperatures up patch

1
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:41,649
of rain but the temperatures up on those of
yesterday.

1
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:43,729
10- 12 degrees widely.

1
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,669
through tuesday evening and overnight, if
we see some gaps in this cloud sheet what

1
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,799
will happen is we get some fog forming and
that fog could become dense, particularly

1
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,298
across england and wales.

1
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,898
hills of the northern ireland, scotland having
clear whether an cold weather with pockets

1
00:27:58,898 --> 00:28:00,608
of frost.

1
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:03,878
wednesday morning, bear in mind, if we do
see fog it has the

1
00:28:03,878 --> 00:28:07,719
potential to be quite thick and it could last
while as well.

1
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,118
we may well see some localised disruption
through wednesday.

1
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:14,759
if you do not have fobbed you will stay cloudy
through much of the day and in any case across

1
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:20,929
england, ireland and northern -- wales and
northern ireland, a band of rain will move

1
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:25,890
into the relatively mild for most and temperatures
reaching a high of 13 degrees.

1
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:31,520
this is business briefing, i'm sally bundock.

1
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,648
the art of the deal.

1
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:37,008
trump's team says the us has struck $300 billion
worth of trade and investment deals during

1
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:38,009
his asian trip.

1
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,679
we investigate. and president trump's determination
to slash regulations for us business is alarming

1
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,769
many who worry about pollution and public
health.

1
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,989
and on the markets in asia today, shares fluctuate,
a day afterjapanâ€™s main market saw its biggest

1
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:44,358
drop since april.

1
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:10,329
It's one of the world's greatest engineering wonders the great wall of China

1
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:15,609
They say it can even be seen from space

1
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,359
It's a military masterpiece that has witnessed hundreds of backwards yet it still holds many mysteries

1
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:37,070
British writer and Historian William Lindsay has lived in China for 20 years exploring the great [wall] has become his lifetime obsession

1
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:44,589
Lindsay has spent thousands of days on has walked thousands of kilometers [and]

1
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,408
Is the great [war] really how many years did it take to build?

1
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:59,570
And why was it built to talk crap on [salary] or Roll to your quarters?

1
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:26,427
It's only a short trip from beijing to one of China's most popular attractions

1
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:33,688
Millions of tourists come here every year to see the stone dragon the great wall of China

1
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,368
Most of the people walking on the great war here today will go home and say I've been to the great wall of China

1
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:50,548
But the great [wall] is not a place it ranges across the sub-continental expanse of [North] China

1
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,219
And along its course

1
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:56,039
many of the locations seldom visited

1
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:59,028
And some virtually unknown

1
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,528
in 1987 [busy] fulfilled his childhood dream

1
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,539
He walked on the Chinese war two thousand seven hundred kilometers

1
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,939
Only a few pictures remain from this adventure because his films were repeatedly confiscated foreigners were barred from many parts of China

1
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,459
Those times have long changed

1
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:26,348
China has opened up to the world and an adventure has turned into a scholar

1
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:31,598
[Lindsay] now seeks out traces of the [great] [wall] of [China] right across the country

1
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,249
23 years after his first trip he sets off again

1
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,329
during the same

1
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:45,788
exploring 23 years later is really a testament to the

1
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,709
immensity of

1
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,709
What we call the [great] [wall] of [China]

1
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:58,060
[will] be [our] [hearts] in the last two-and-a-half decades. I explored the warm or 1700 days

1
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:05,438
[I've] discovered. It's the world's most famous building, but the least-known there's always something new to discover

1
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,709
there is

1
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,980
there is no single great warm there are lots of words in Northern China built by different dynasties for more than

1
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,900
2,000 years

1
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,959
William Lindsey is taking us to one of the most remote places

1
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:28,298
2300 Kilometer Drive, West of Beijing to the City of doing one

1
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:34,318
into the Gobi desert

1
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,839
[clearly] that 75 miles Northwest of don't want

1
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,260
And it's a nice sunny day in the gobi doesn't perfect conditions for exploring the great wall

1
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,500
In the shimmering heat the dark Ribbon along the Horizon at first looks like a mirage, but these really are the remains of a war

1
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,139
literally in the middle of nowhere

1
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:18,778
Well one of the most precious parts of the [great] [wall] of [China]. This is the hand war hell 2100 years ago

1
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,869
And [I'm] not the first traffic to come here. This is the silk Road

1
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:29,368
So merchants would come from the deserts in Central, Asia

1
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,670
entering [China] at this point and then

1
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,850
Proceed East to the Heartland of [China]

1
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,810
So it's going to take a closer look

1
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:51,798
Built over 2,000 years ago this wall looks completely different to the familiar Great [warley] efficient. It's not built of stone

1
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:58,279
But this construction material has kept its strong for Millennia read and gravel

1
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,009
But who [is] this war meant to protect so far from Civilization?

1
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,090
the Han Dynasty

1
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,560
Rulers wanted to open Their empire to trade with the West

1
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,599
So they secured control of the eastern end of what became known as the silk Road?

1
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,430
the Han Chinese

1
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,540
occupied the vital [if] [she] colony

1
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,000
That runs along the road between them more than steps and the [himalayan] hotels

1
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,709
It's a real border not just between peoples, but between lifestyle

1
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,448
the Nomads of the Step vignettes traditional round tent

1
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:48,257
They live entirely from their livestock [wandering] over the step they pitch there. Yes, wherever they find grazing land for their herds

1
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:03,528
after enduring long hard winters in the steps these nomadic warriors ransacked China's Northern provinces

1
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:12,799
Year after year they killed [road] stealing food and metals everything their lifestyle prevents the producing

1
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:21,248
The Chinese regarded their empire as the cradle of civilization

1
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,298
According to their confusion philosophy it was the cultural center of the world

1
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,519
Appeasing the Barbarians along the water by trading is out of the question

1
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:37,268
[all] was too expensive so the harm emperor decided to build a war

1
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:43,040
How many people were involved in the construction of the harm or no one knows for sure?

1
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,419
Reliable sources quote the calculations presented to the emperor

1
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:56,059
If one soldier can build three [places] of war in one month than 300 and build three [leap] about one-and-a-Half kilometres

1
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:03,438
That means a thousand Li were about [500] [30] kilometers would take a hundred thousand men one month to complete

1
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,149
So far so good

1
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,149
and so many

1
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:16,608
Most of the soldiers were stationed at the towers the towers had a dual use that made the most effective defense

1
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,910
[the] Beacon town behind me was not only the perfect vantage

1
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:27,759
Point [four] guards on this frontier to watch for the enemy coming from the north [it] was a signaling station

1
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:32,169
So when the animal was cited this beacon would have been ignited

1
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,259
This is how it worked as soon as a guard spotted nomadic warriors

1
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,669
He transmitted smoke signals by Daylight, or Beacon fires at night

1
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,840
The alarm was communicated along the wall to [Garrison's] located in the Hinterland

1
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:56,819
How long is the ham war only recently have [Chinese] experts started to find?

1
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,058
Join the local archaeological survey ting

1
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,110
taking part in a national survey

1
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,810
to locate dynasty

1
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,900
A team is heading out into the [gobi] desert. They need a whole summer just to measure this section

1
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,819
At noon the temperature can decline to the 40 degrees celsius?

1
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,558
Today the team is exploring a fortification that lies in the hinterland of the [hardwar]

1
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,769
This could have been a Garrison for support Troops

1
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,330
Today the remains are hardly visible

1
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,209
Right here, and [that's] all you guys hear this tower has a name

1
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:57,829
it's called half Tower obviously because half the tower is missing the team here today to locate the

1
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,899
Fortifications with GPS and wondering how they're going to measure the height because it's so Crumbly, [Alaska]

1
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,039
needs a [Ma]

1
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:11,958
Their dog are high challenge you [were] you another Paula [only] all [touchy] you are so that?

1
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
You can get that [other] [players] are

1
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,409
Only used for year [and] [will] not cold weather are

1
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,048
So they don't have to have to climb up the tower to measure it. They have a device here

1
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,010
[right] here

1
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:29,269
Hey the laser rangefinder Connects the data

1
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,498
It will be a Few years before the results of the survey are

1
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,220
summarized and a figure can be given for the length of the harm war

1
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,840
The challenge opens a lot of your body are [organized] [or] so from here to the Jade gates is about

1
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,779
45 50 kilometers

1
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,359
And there are three sections of war that are quite visible

1
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,338
And in between there's virtually nothing although the archaeologists may find traces

1
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:06,820
Mr.. Young is very little reluctant to give a guesstimate of how many kilometers of hand wall standing

1
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:18,990
[GPS], team Leader, Mr.

1
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,560
[jung] has given William

1
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:27,958
directions to a place in the desert where the wall has a unique shape it's a 16 kilometres hike so william is buying provisions for

1
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,958
The trip but don't [want] market

1
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,778
well

1
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,258
Roll Mate would be very good chance in the desert

1
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,509
[yeah]

1
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,840
A lot of what he sees doesn't seem too useful for a desert trick, but he finally finds what he needs

1
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,949
successful shopping trip for 199 also put supply of High-energy foods

1
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
directors

1
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:06,249
Next morning, and find the clock [Lindsay] sets off for the hike

1
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,899
also select

1
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:14,798
It's 14.4 K so it's about

1
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,339
99 miles or more he's not walking alone in the desert it would be too dangerous

1
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:24,129
With him is his Chinese friend

1
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:29,949
El cajon [sun] coming [up] that their GPS says they will reach the unique strip of wall in five hours

1
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,470
[yeah]

1
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,829
It's cool. No, but the Sparse vegetation is [tinder-dry] there hasn't been any rainfall here for months

1
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:13,549
[then] walking in the featureless landscape can see a solitary tree over

1
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,870
in 87

1
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,048
[I] just had a big [mouth] for the whole country

1
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,279
Basically my journey along the wall from the desert to the sea

1
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,159
Was like that

1
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:43,288
1700 miles not the ideal [Map] for [Hiking] across desert Grassland

1
00:12:55,448 --> 00:13:03,149
It's nearly noon and the sun is burning, but finally they arrived at the place. They've been looking for there it is

1
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
right that

1
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
[lasted] [A]

1
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,729
great

1
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:20,610
Act brand for William it's already worth the trip even the five hours back amazing. Hey

1
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Look at that fantastic

1
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:38,049
Of all the faces that the great wall of China house, this is the rarest of [them] [off]

1
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,769
This wall is made of wood

1
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,359
He has six layers of branches there

1
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,850
and

1
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:57,009
And in between minimal use of the gravel, so I'm really glad I've come here today well worth the 10 mile track

1
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:09,399
Leaving the doing one region and making his way D stand on the ancient silk Road Williams aiming for a town called [John] [Glenn]

1
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,769
The Historic site is five kilometers out of town

1
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:19,088
And the best view is from the sky

1
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:37,649
a giant castle guarding the [wall] built in 1539 by judging emperor of the Ming Dynasty

1
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,959
The main Emperor's contempt for the Nomads reached protest proportions with the demand that the character [g]

1
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,559
Standing for Barbarians should be written as small as possible

1
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:12,139
After the han Dynasty other dynasties rose and fell many of them built walls, but none of any significant length

1
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,389
Me emperor [genius] [ended] the Dragon throne in 1521

1
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,668
He renewed the [hun] tradition established in ancient times

1
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,788
Constructing a long wall of the Northern border with its westernmost point at the jog one pass

1
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,779
[Jaguar] translates as a barrier to the Pleasant Valley and Pleasant Valley means China

1
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,359
This gigantic fault is built in the foothills of the himalayas

1
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,700
In the courtyard the mighty walls form a kind of maze to stop invaders in their tracks

1
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,558
And there's a wonderful legend about its construction

1
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:16,149
To Avoid wastage of materials prior to construction of the fortress the architect was asked to calculate exactly how many bricks

1
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,490
required be computed

1
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,050
[999999] the Bricks were delivered the fortress built and at the end the chief of works

1
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:32,769
Confronted the architect with a brick and said this is wasted, but the architect was too smart

1
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,198
He said no I factored that into the equation

1
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:39,759
That brick should be placed over the portal and it will bring

1
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,089
All the guards in the fortress and all of those travelers passing under its portals good fortune

1
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,279
600 Years later the Leftover Brick still remains

1
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,299
[yeah]

1
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:00,909
[yeah]

1
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,089
Next to the fort is the starting point of the wall constructed by the [way]

1
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,869
This wall has nothing in common with the brick and stone

1
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:30,408
[it's] made of rammed the [loads] more than 400 years old and still in good shape and [its] still wide enough to walk

1
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,119
[yeah]

1
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:06,028
On his walks along the Walls [William] [Lindsay] soon Learned. He could count on receiving warm hospitality from the farmers among the wedding

1
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,068
Before coming to China my family and friends were very concerned in

1
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,428
1987 going to [China] the big

1
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,899
Communist country on the other side of the world all the people going to be friendly

1
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:30,239
And I didn't have a support crew with me on [dependent] on Farmers. [I] discovered very early on the farmers were my

1
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,409
great

1
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:35,429
allies even with very little [Chinese]

1
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:41,579
But a lot of sign language and smiling [I] got what I needed food water shelter without them

1
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:44,668
I couldn't have been successful Asean come on

1
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:52,018
I seea even if many is unkind understand why a foreigner should be so interested in the wall

1
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:58,518
Then this is no monument, but simply a part of the village and one with a perfectly practical use

1
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:05,969
I was asking my er the these holes in the wall. I thought they were nasty but in fact

1
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:12,117
Previously the farms were right up against the wall, so [they're] wooden

1
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:19,318
Beams going into the wall, but the great wall experts the cultural heritage protection authorities

1
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,499
requested the Farmers to

1
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:29,610
Destroy those buildings and move back in [order] in order to protect the national heritage if you want to know how many

1
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:35,278
Dynasty [Mason's] constructed their [wall] more than 400 years ago [what] you have to do is keep your eyes open

1
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,019
even today

1
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:43,190
Chinese Farmers build walls of the same way their ancestors did they tempt the earth in a wooden case [if]

1
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,619
temp put layer on layer

1
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,538
They even sing the traditional folk songs passed down from their forefathers

1
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,440
A house is not complete without a wall around it

1
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,170
[says] an old Chinese proverb

1
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,798
My friend Tran is building this wall to and closed his compound, so this is the final piece of work

1
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,490
and

1
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,910
This is embedded in Chinese

1
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,549
Architectural tradition

1
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,440
whether it's a compound

1
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,940
For a village or a kingdom it must be enclosed

1
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,910
completely safe

1
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,400
They built up most of the men wore just like this is a [rounder] [swore]

1
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,588
Imagine how many billion [birds] it took?

1
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,999
[Georgia] guns on each [Unger] Tower 10 sure

1
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:56,029
Busy Long-ago

1
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:05,900
Oh, I hated [husband] the singing is an important part of the work. It keeps all the rappers

1
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,019
And staff the beat

1
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,839
So another [Lauren] step going along the wall [get] into a rhythm

1
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,940
and

1
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,940
the actual content

1
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,240
or

1
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,308
I've been trying to 23 here is where this guy has [a] really [heavy] [accent]

1
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:29,269
[it's] a bit difficult, but that it's definitely a kind of wrap

1
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,418
[it] changes the words and occasionally hear them chuckle

1
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,610
So I think [he] gets a little dig in about those that are kind of falling behind in

1
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:43,009
Distance or maybe he can tell by the [third's] if someone is answered

1
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:58,678
This group of about twenty farmers mostly women took a day to erect about 27 meters of war

1
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,549
We don't know if their ancestors could have worked better or faster

1
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,919
But we do know they would have used the same materials and tools

1
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,799
except [for] the tractors carrying the clay

1
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,729
and the cell phones [by] [Dover]

1
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,539
[Scylla], Ola

1
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:30,369
[yeah]

1
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:51,419
On his Journey along the Walls of China

1
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:58,798
Williamses looking eastwards out of the [He-she] corridor and turning North along the great wall of the ming Dynasty

1
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,720
into the [great] [gloop] of the [Yellow] [River] the cradle of China's civilization

1
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,360
This has always been the Gateway for the Nomads to Enter China

1
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:35,367
Here the wind and weather have done their worst the wall and its towers can still be made out on the cracks of the river

1
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:53,410
The Garrison Forts with the outpost of this defensive outer warm today. They use is strictly [non-military]

1
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:04,329
[yeah]

1
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
[yeah]

1
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,799
[ok]

1
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,119
[I] love staying in the countryside

1
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:32,529
This building. It's made of thick blocks of limestone and on the roof this stuff when you come here winter

1
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,588
[no] good method for keeping you warm see this

1
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,519
[it's] not that it's called the Camp [Kng]

1
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,629
And they put the fuel and here light it can do the cooking here

1
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,089
You've got a nice warm bed for the night

1
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,640
So I got full board and lodging

1
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:04,240
Breakfast morning and dinner this evening and lunch coming up soon for less than ten dollars

1
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,650
[ha]

1
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:35,189
I should apologize for the slurping it's part and parcel of eating in China

1
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,789
Considered sound of an appreciation

1
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:51,719
The ingredients of the Lunch [William] is appreciating today also the reason the Nomads raided the land of the yellow River throughout

1
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
the 16th Century

1
00:25:55,538 --> 00:26:01,689
[yeah] in the year 1549 the barbarians come to plunder

1
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,669
[yeah]

1
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,759
[yeah]

1
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:29,160
[redick] cavalry to a virtual standstill at the new Border war that shoe and food

1
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,280
The wall stands fast the Nomadic troops are unable to capture the [Chinese] ground

1
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,410
Does this mean defeat [you]?

1
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,649
The Barbarians do not give up the message for the Chinese

1
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,789
They will attack beijing the capital

1
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:56,558
By marching [east] the Nomads Army finds its way around the wall thus avoiding the ming emperor's Elaborate border fortifications

1
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:03,818
No one had suspected the Nomads could cross the natural barrier the Mountain range North Vision

1
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,847
Back in 1550 the Nomads did not meet with any serious opposition on their way south

1
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:24,458
They terrorized beijing suburbs for three days

1
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:27,069
They demanded trading rights

1
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,030
Leaving the Forbidden City

1
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,469
untouched before drawing back to the steps

1
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:41,750
After a short period of trading the ming emperor started building a wall of stone not of beijing

1
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,839
between the 15 fifties and

1
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
1644 it reached a length of at least

1
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:53,328
1,200 kilometers the stone Dragon the Chinese great [wall] as the world knows it today

1
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:05,568
How many people were needed to build it?

1
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:08,749
official figures are rare but in some

1
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:14,808
Inaccessible sections of the wall there are still stone tablets in [grave] with texts that could give us that information

1
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:24,689
Good

1
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,340
I'm hoping this stone is going to tell me something about when this wall was built

1
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:35,869
How many people were involved and mentioned some place names from here the inscription looks very faint, but we have a ladder

1
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:41,478
Master Artisan Mr.. [Hull], and with his simple tools. We're going to

1
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:49,009
Copy the stone and produce a rubbing which hopefully will reveal the full content of the tablet

1
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:07,399
This ancient Chinese copying technique starts with blowing a sheet of paper onto the template simply with water

1
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:13,158
This is step number one step number two

1
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:18,379
Dads are translates literally as typing characters are using a brush

1
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:22,238
[and] he's hammering the paper into the carvings

1
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,830
the higher

1
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,359
parts of the paper

1
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,359
Will be blackened and the lower parts that have gone into the characters and any

1
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:02,869
design along the Edges there will remain white

1
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,828
After three hours of sponging and drying Mr.. [cole] presents his peace of God

1
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,008
It looks like a blueprint for an old archive document

1
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:32,658
[are] [all] [I] am Monica and helps william translate the ancient Chinese characters?

1
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:35,298
Which today have the anybody can read?

1
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,799
our

1
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,359
diggity

1
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,709
dog

1
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,710
[brought]. [I] want to draw add up

1
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,279
[hard] just have bad [won't] [buy] [a] book

1
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:54,080
That was younger all [filled] up [yunyun] [get] this stone is telling us that [to]

1
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,839
military officials in charge of

1
00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,369
1100 Families

1
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,879
put in the effort to build

1
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:08,689
250 yards of war in the autumn of 1579 so in terms of very simple

1
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:14,420
arithmetic productivity, we're talking about four persons per family

1
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:23,569
4,500 people working for eight to ten weeks in the autumn of 1579 to build that

1
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,499
[we're] [a] stamped Earth Walls were built by untrained surface or presents this project required special knowledge

1
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,680
hundreds of Master Builders and skilled engineers

1
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,680
Thousands of Stone cutters and tens of thousands of Mason's were recruited to build the war

1
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:48,138
And another factor, led to the costs rising exponential

1
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:06,690
[Tamped] Earth Walls were built using materials available on-site

1
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:11,549
The material for the new [and] to be manufactured before use

1
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:20,220
The Chinese [had] devised a network of Brick kilns set up near the construction sites one of these sites was found by local farmers

1
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:26,128
and inspected by professor 12 new curator of the Great war Museum in [showing] [1]

1
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:33,689
so at this location they discovered around 60 brick kilns and it ranks as the

1
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:37,528
best Production center of Bricks

1
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:44,430
Preserved along the whole length of the great [war] and it's estimated that each kill

1
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:50,548
could fire five thousand bricks now given that there are 60 kilns in this valley the

1
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:55,288
production of this [Center] Alone would be equal to

1
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,820
three hundred

1
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:01,308
thousand bricks per month industrial scale production

1
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:11,219
Then is now mass production is one thing, but it's a different matter to Transport the product to where it's needed

1
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,269
logistics

1
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
[yeah]

1
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:23,528
now key question very interesting question is how did they move all the bricks of the

1
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,169
One show need to add a [normally]

1
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,380
Challenges Sham [Mk]. Coming up on why, Georgia track down John

1
00:33:32,648 --> 00:33:36,158
Show me again there is almost no historical record to answer this question

1
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,519
But professor one has his theory

1
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:45,968
[should] hear something people may have carried a few bricks on their backs like this

1
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:52,778
And also it's been suggested a herd of goats could have carried a lot of bricks up there quite effectively

1
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:57,368
War two bricks on the back of the goat and the bricks are joined together

1
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:01,749
With rope so the goat is quite balanced as it's moving up the mountain

1
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:08,898
[yeah]

1
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:14,239
Even without brakes on your back. It's a hard slog up to the wall, but it's worth it

1
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,199
Hardly any tourists make it to this isolated section

1
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,530
[yeah]

1
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,508
Every time I come up here on this trials a spare for the builders

1
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,048
Had to heave [porsche] all of this building material of hell these blocks all of this trick

1
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:54,528
Sometimes Bizarre route taken by this war has led many experts to believe that more than just defensive

1
00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:01,220
Considerations were in play here and for generations. [the] Chinese have followed the practice of fun [Schwee]

1
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:04,099
the teachings of the wind and water

1
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,699
function where experts were probably

1
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:13,880
Concepted and debate before the building of the wall to make sure that the forces of nature would work in its favor

1
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:26,420
Spending his days alone on the wall, [Nz] imagines. How the soldiers must have suffered here cut off from the world

1
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,030
enduring wins and foul weather

1
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,719
Squeezed into bear and cramped quarters for months on [N]

1
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,949
[yeah]

1
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,709
Finally this war is a monument to the closed world view of the empire

1
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:04,249
[is] circumscribed their universe and excluded everything that was for?

1
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:14,600
Often scratching around in this rubble, you can find bits of pottery sure what this stone asst

1
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:19,789
Students [pointing] system [may] [be] a broken it

1
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,579
[ok] [yeah]

1
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,809
[ok]

1
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,619
might be

1
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,909
that

1
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:45,909
is

1
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:48,108
A

1
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:50,108
stone bomb

1
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:52,748
That would have been packed with gunpowder

1
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,619
A mud seal [refuse]

1
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:01,599
And the towns like this was all just packed with these maybe fifty or hundred

1
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:04,159
to be

1
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,989
dropped off the wall when the tower was attacked

1
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,170
That's a really good find

1
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:22,960
[yeah], 320 kilometers further east we find another example of living history

1
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:31,230
should trigger some holy lady [Eagle] [hollister] like the bottle and [ordered] [a] yellow for

1
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:39,119
This is John hirsh on his ancestors built a wall here four [hundred] [and] [forty] years ago

1
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,730
and close by

1
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:47,728
Towers have other family names like the chant our the wang towel the law tower, so we're here

1
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,990
We have the family history of the great [wall] still living on

1
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
440 Years after it was built

1
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:08,438
Even today they still worship their ancestors by celebrating ancient festivals

1
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:18,919
[man], the Pig was closed yesterday should be quite nice fresh [for]

1
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:26,059
It would have been a rare moment of relaxation and abundance in a hard life

1
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:40,510
As the oldest member of his family Mr.. General makes the sacrifice to his ancestors and burns incense sticks

1
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:51,869
[yeah], [ok]

1
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:04,179
[any] the living generations of the junk family bowed to the dead and to their own great mystery?

1
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,569
The Village families had to look after and feed the soldiers in the tablets

1
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,610
There take away food service survives to this day

1
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:34,579
Janish and Farmer down in transient Village prepared some delicacies for me

1
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:37,848
Munch on up here after my hike

1
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,778
And it's amazing to think that 400 years ago

1
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:45,409
Guards [Garrison] up on the wall will be sent these

1
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
[lobbying] by their families

1
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
so look

1
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
It's a kind of pasty

1
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,410
caps Fresh in one of these large Oak leaves

1
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,099
[you] can see the leaf prints on the pastry

1
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,780
[ever] taste

1
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,519
Hmm

1
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,519
follow tribes

1
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:20,510
Kind of try and try this hamburger. Maybe the original Chinese takeaway for those up on the wall

1
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
[yeah]

1
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,690
by

1
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:40,108
1644 just short of a hundred Years of construction the most impressive defensive wall ever made by man was finished

1
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:49,090
however, it was not one single [great] [wall] it comprised a system of several Defense lines from the Mountains to

1
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,090
the sea

1
00:40:54,159 --> 00:41:00,608
In 2009 after a national survey of the ming wall Chinese officials announced that the total length is

1
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,150
8850 Kilometers

1
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:09,538
This is the end Chug one meaning Mountain see parts

1
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:21,528
the Chinese like in the [main] great [walls] [were] [dragons] sneaking across their land and here it comes to a

1
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:25,189
Geographical and that's all dragons had [of] the [Loc]

1
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:32,719
Not far from this location in 1644 the commander of Shanghai [guan] faced his biggest challenge

1
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:38,929
An event which [led] to the end of the great wall functioning as a national defense

1
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:47,989
Professor one is taking William to the gates and walls in the outskirts of shang one

1
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:51,858
This is the place where the great [wall] story came to an end

1
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:57,738
The construction of the great wall led to the financial and strategic

1
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:00,409
collapse of the Ming Dynasty

1
00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:02,958
Revolts broke out everywhere in the Empire

1
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:07,848
An Army of Rebel peasants marched on beijing where they toppled the emperor?

1
00:42:08,188 --> 00:42:12,018
Then on to Shanghai [Guan] the last stronghold of the ming Empire

1
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:17,858
But a mighty army had risen from the steps heading for the middle Kingdom the Manchus

1
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:25,469
Caught in between some [Wii]. He was the general in command of the fortress of [suge] one

1
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,860
Now he was under siege

1
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:37,398
What would he do this was a powerful Garrison that wasn't strong enough to fight off attackers on [two] friends

1
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:41,579
[yeah]

1
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,679
[lightyear] not having to do about

1
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:53,269
[that] [beef] when professor want to know about tells [when] [you're] [missing] the solution he found [on] gravity for the old one so trapped between

1
00:42:53,268 --> 00:42:59,778
Two enemies commander was angry. [I] knew he couldn't defeat them both, so we came up with a plan to offer a

1
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:06,528
alliance Treaty with the Manchus in the North and the two armies joined and

1
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:13,369
Confronted the [peasant] rebel army and they defeated them the wall is only as strong as the men who guard it

1
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:19,609
Genghis Khan is supposed to have said his successes from the steps the Manchus would have agreed with

1
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:24,799
80,000 Manchu soldiers pass through this gate

1
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:26,880
and answered

1
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,930
the

1
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:34,940
Heartland of China the Manchus founded a new Dynasty which in effect ruled over the Middle Kingdom until Nineteen Twelve

1
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,789
They call themselves [ching] meaning the pure

1
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:49,099
And the great wall is of no use anymore

1
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,120
But its story did not come to an end

1
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:59,298
Even today nobody knows how long all the great walls of China really are

1
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:04,340
There are still many more walls and stories to be discovered

1
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:10,159
And [William] [Lindsay] will not stop walking the great wall until he knows them

1
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:16,910
I don't think in future and so many people will be organized in such a methodical way

1
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:22,039
To create something that was not just history that not just fell apart

1
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,380
[but] is left as part of the geography of China and the world

1
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:30,498
Certainly in future there are going to be new wonders

1
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:34,998
communications longer life exploring planets

1
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:40,068
But in terms of blood sweat and tears the Great wall of China

1
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,108
I think is the ultimate that's why I'm continuing to understand

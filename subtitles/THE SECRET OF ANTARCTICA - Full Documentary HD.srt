1
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:08,388
it's a mystery continent at the bottom of the earth

1
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:10,339
of the world

1
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,000
And the single largest mass of ice on Earth.

1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,789
Earth

1
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:21,229
for longer than humans have walked the

1
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:29,469
planet ice has dominated Antarctica

1
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,450
but what about the future. "ice melts from

1
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,890
this continent...

1
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,910
...Sea Level goes up."

1
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,660
as earth gets warmer what will happen to

1
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:48,569
Antarctica. "We're going into uncertain

1
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,509
lands uncertain future.

1
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,488
how will the earth respond?"  Today a

1
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,149
pioneering team is searching for answers,

1
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,179
with a bold new plan and a revolutionary

1
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,090
new machine no one has ever drove through

1
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,650
an  ice (unintelligable) and I present these challenges

1
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,570
they must drill down nearly a mile and

1
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,839
more than 20 million years deep into

1
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,509
Antarctica's ancient history in this

1
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,840
unforgiving place it's never been done

1
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,049
before it's quite amazing when you think

1
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,069
about where we are and what we're doing

1
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,739
anything can go wrong at any minute the

1
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,679
stakes are high because the secret to

1
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,530
Earth's future lies buried in

1
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,079
Antarctica's past right now on nova

1
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,890
secrets beneath the ice

1
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,960
it's the coldest windiest driest and

1
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,860
most desolate landscape on the planet

1
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,380
with few permanent residents except

1
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:32,900
penguins and seals this frosty cotton

1
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,550
appears locked in a perpetual Ice Age a

1
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,260
colossal cloak of ice covers almost

1
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,079
every inch of land and in some places

1
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,230
the ice is so thick and so heavy it

1
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:47,629
depresses the Earth's crust almost half

1
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:55,069
a mile some people call it Earth's

1
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,979
freezer but scientists call Antarctica

1
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,699
the ice

1
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,159
Antartica plays a fundamental role in

1
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,219
the way the earth functions for polar

1
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,349
researchers Antarctica is a giant

1
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,030
laboratory more than one and a half

1
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,509
times the size of the United States and

1
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:18,299
home to 90% of all the ice in the world

1
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,550
anything that happens down here anything

1
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,830
that changes will affect the rest of the

1
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,620
world most people don't think that

1
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,259
change in Antarctica matters to them but

1
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,000
when we look at New York City and we

1
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,039
looked at it's in front of the ocean it

1
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,609
matters

1
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,959
what would happen if all of Antarctica's

1
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,070
ice were to melts

1
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:44,039
antarctica melts sea level goes up

1
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,530
twelve stories in New York City sea

1
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,680
levels would rise by more than 150 feet

1
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,979
flooding coastal cities displacing

1
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,199
hundreds of millions of people that

1
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,519
would be a change that you could see

1
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,490
from space earth would look different in

1
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,580
any case even a loss of just 10% of

1
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,320
Antarctica's ice would be catastrophic

1
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,689
it would raise the sea level over there

1
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:18,620
in Manhattan about 19 feet right up

1
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,110
along the edge big sections of Brooklyn

1
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,720
would be underwater certainly the

1
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,760
Mediterranean some of my favorite cities

1
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,569
like Venice would look very different

1
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,649
tens of millions of people would have to

1
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,719
be relocated to be almost different

1
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,710
different planet if sea level changes in

1
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,959
the climate around the coastal regions

1
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,129
change it's going to affect the climate

1
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:41,600
where you live it's going to affect the

1
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,460
things you can you can grow is going to

1
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,549
affect how you have you live there may

1
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,230
be a list of things in store that come

1
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,810
as a result of raising sea levels that

1
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,629
we haven't even thought about yet could

1
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,290
this be our fate is Antarctica heading

1
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,400
for a major meltdown if so it may happen

1
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,939
over centuries but it could already be

1
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:12,389
starting because the climate is changing

1
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,939
and it's changing because burning fossil

1
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,189
fuels has increased the level of carbon

1
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:20,490
dioxide in the atmosphere today we have

1
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,439
something that's completely man-made and

1
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,569
that is the addition of carbon dioxide

1
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,000
and put into the atmosphere by humanity

1
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,408
by us carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas

1
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:33,168
it prevents the sun's heat from escaping

1
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:35,968
I'm in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in a

1
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,579
greenhouse greenhouses there are

1
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,109
basically like heat motels

1
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,538
where the sun's rays can come in and

1
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:44,250
they get trapped inside the greenhouse

1
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,538
they can't get out

1
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,139
so like glass in a greenhouse gases like

1
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,110
carbon dioxide trap solar energy in our

1
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,500
atmosphere but now those levels are

1
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,680
increasing the result is our earth is

1
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,699
now warming up and the ice is melting

1
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:11,189
both in Antarctica and the Arctic in the

1
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,400
north there's two clear signals in the

1
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,439
Arctic Ocean you have lots of floating

1
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,538
ice and not sticking around through the

1
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:19,050
summer

1
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,180
that's one sign of it getting warmer the

1
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,088
other side the edges of the Greenland

1
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:27,060
ice sheet are changing and the loss of

1
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,838
Greenland's ice is now speeding up in

1
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:34,168
August 2010 and iceberg four times the

1
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,568
size of Manhattan broke off the edge of

1
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,319
Greenland

1
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,629
but Antarctica has nearly ten times as

1
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:44,029
much ice as Greenland and in the past

1
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,459
decade alone rising temperatures have

1
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,889
caused giant pieces of coastal ice to

1
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,329
shrink or crumble polar researchers fear

1
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,430
that this could be just the beginning of

1
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,790
a chain reaction but have Antarctica's

1
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,750
ice sheets ever collapsed before that's

1
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,430
what an international team of geo

1
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,009
detectives wants to find out here we

1
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,569
actually have some running water some

1
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,480
melt water coming out of the ice to get

1
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,430
a more precise picture of Antarctica's

1
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,639
future they plan to dig deep for answers

1
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,639
in the past with a giant drill by

1
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,500
drilling into areas around the Erika

1
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,389
we're able to perceive a history that

1
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,699
has an impact for where we're headed as

1
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,430
a planet Antarctica was not always

1
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,600
locked in a deep freeze 160 million

1
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,850
years ago it was part of an enormous

1
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,090
supercontinent closer to the equator at

1
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,489
the time earth was much warmer than

1
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,490
today and fossil evidence suggests this

1
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,370
giant landmass was a tropical habitat

1
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,389
teeming with Dinosaurs eventually the

1
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:52,039
supercontinent broke apart and

1
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,640
Antarctica drifted south as Earth was

1
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,860
getting colder falling carbon dioxide

1
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,080
levels and powerful ocean currents

1
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,060
cooled the isolated continent even

1
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,930
further and then around 34 million years

1
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,980
ago ice slowly began to form it would

1
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,230
take millions of years for Antarctica to

1
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,530
finally lock into a deep freeze and

1
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,449
during that time it remained warm enough

1
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,379
for plant life to survive evidence of

1
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,240
that was recently unearthed in a

1
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,949
relatively ice-free Valley in the

1
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,430
interior here geologist Alan Ashworth

1
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,399
and Adam Lewis find a remarkable fossil

1
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,240
oh wait is that a leaf there's a leaf

1
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,279
right there that leaf fell into the mud

1
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,799
maybe 20 million years ago suddenly do

1
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,159
the best is yet that's a sweet leaf and

1
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,610
then they find something extraordinary

1
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,730
this is like a peat peat moss and then

1
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,090
if we take T some of this out there

1
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,379
flight freeze-dried under the microscope

1
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,870
these brittle mosses are in pristine

1
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,060
condition

1
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:10,219
these moss fossils are not rock but

1
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,340
actual plant tissue the last vestiges of

1
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,740
vegetation from a time when Antarctica

1
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,019
was still warm

1
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,220
they were found under a layer of

1
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,889
volcanic ash that dates back millions of

1
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,559
years this is the original moss tissue

1
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,289
and even the cells are preserved in

1
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,689
these fossils these plants were

1
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,000
flash-frozen when an article plummeted

1
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,580
into a deep freeze that preserved them

1
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,870
until today it's mind-boggling the only

1
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,049
way is to say the climate remained very

1
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,419
very cold it remained very very dry and

1
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,269
it did not warm up for even relatively

1
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,689
short periods of time in this location

1
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,530
otherwise these things are gone

1
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,179
now as Earth is heating up what will

1
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,319
happen to Antarctica will it melt

1
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,900
raising sea levels all over the planet

1
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,539
how sensitive is this frozen land to the

1
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,839
temperature changes we currently face

1
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,670
but before researchers can investigate

1
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:17,250
in Antarctica last-minute testing is

1
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,639
taking place here over 2,000 miles away

1
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,569
in the countryside of New Zealand with a

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:31,560
brand new drill yeah it's a shakedown

1
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,709
we've got a few leaking connections and

1
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,019
things that don't quite fit as well as I

1
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,789
need to a little bit of modifications

1
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,679
required pretty common with a brand new

1
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,109
piece of equipment weighing in at a

1
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,379
whopping 40 tonnes this mechanized

1
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,509
marvel is as heavy as a humpback whale

1
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:52,950
and just as large towering some 5

1
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,740
stories high the giant rig will soon

1
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,740
dwarf everything in sight except the ice

1
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,230
this will be the largest Rorick in

1
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,070
Antarctica that's used on land and this

1
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,290
mammoth rig can drill in more than one

1
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:10,529
place that's because it's mounted on a

1
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,319
sled I think it probably is unusual all

1
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,600
of the equipment is on sledges so in

1
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,399
Antartica we pull it all with pygmy

1
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,590
bulldozers it's been specially designed

1
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,379
to drill from the ice in order to

1
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,750
extract hidden secrets from beneath

1
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,870
Antarctica itself

1
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,120
this unique multinational enterprise is

1
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,610
called an drill the Antarctic drilling

1
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,720
project for team leader David Harwood

1
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,019
it's a dream come true as a scientist

1
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,850
there's a passion there's a passion that

1
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,610
comes in trying to figure it out trying

1
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,169
to identify what has been the past

1
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,360
history of the ice sheet and wondering

1
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,860
what the future might hold

1
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,769
soon the giant drill will be dismantled

1
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:58,318
and ready for a long sea voyage this

1
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,659
will get you to take your extreme cold

1
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,509
weather days off but now the andrel team

1
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,000
gathers at Christchurch New Zealand for

1
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,278
the six-hour flight to Antarctica in a

1
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,220
c-17 cargo plane jam-packed with people

1
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,970
and gear their flight passes over the

1
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,519
Transantarctic mountains which divide

1
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,740
the continent into two regions with

1
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,870
colossal glaciers called ice sheets

1
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,679
blanketing both the giant East Antarctic

1
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,049
Ice Sheet is ten times the size of the

1
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:31,620
West it's frozen firmly to bedrock high

1
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,560
above the sea and in some places the ice

1
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,359
towers almost three miles into the sky

1
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,220
the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet is

1
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,670
less stable that's because it rests on

1
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,639
land well below sea level and it extends

1
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,438
hundreds of miles over the ocean in

1
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:53,909
floating ice shelves it's likely East

1
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,159
and West Antarctica will respond very

1
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,078
differently to a warming world

1
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,179
the andreal team touches down in the

1
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,319
West on an icy runway at McMurdo Station

1
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,970
the largest US research base in

1
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:17,580
Antarctica as David Harwood and Richard

1
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,350
levy step out onto the ice

1
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,629
the first thing they notice is the

1
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,120
weather is a bit chilly but it's

1
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,450
beautiful

1
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:36,809
it's October springtime and it's minus

1
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:40,409
20 degrees the earliest I've ever been

1
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,059
down to Antarctica and it's very cold

1
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,949
when the wind picks up it's rather an

1
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,900
unpleasant place to be working when the

1
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,459
wind isn't blowing and the sun shining

1
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,410
it's actually really quite nice but very

1
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:53,189
cold but even a sunny afternoon can turn

1
00:13:53,190 --> 00:14:02,150
nasty in a moment's notice yes all day

1
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,819
McMurdo Station has been a vital hub of

1
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,790
research for over half a century what

1
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,429
began as a tiny outpost as over the

1
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:23,379
years grown into a small town

1
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,600
McMurdo houses a population of 200

1
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,570
people year round but during the

1
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,330
research season it becomes home base for

1
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,500
over a thousand every year McMurdo

1
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,809
supports scores of research projects

1
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:41,719
providing lab facilities food and

1
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,680
supplies and survival training for teams

1
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,750
of scientists who will head out to

1
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,190
remote field camps this season those

1
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,440
numbers include the andrel team of over

1
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,110
50 technicians and researchers from the

1
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,120
u.s. New Zealand Germany and Italy and

1
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,070
rule is funded by their governments and

1
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,790
the National Science Foundation there's

1
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:09,529
probably a week at least of work in

1
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,870
McMurdo where we have to get all of our

1
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,759
gear sorted out getting everything we

1
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,529
need in order to be able to work and

1
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:18,019
survive on the field as they gather

1
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,059
supplies for more than a month on the

1
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:24,619
ice one item is in high demand sugar

1
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,029
actually heats your body it gives you a

1
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:27,889
quick energy especially if you're like

1
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:30,710
freezing and we expect to be very cold

1
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,019
we don't really know how much chocolate

1
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,919
is enough we can take up to 560 candy

1
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,659
bars but I'm looking at this and I'm

1
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:40,490
already getting queasy I'm like oh I

1
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,509
don't know if I can eat this or not as

1
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,850
anvil researchers prepare for life in

1
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,340
the field they join hundreds of other

1
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,740
scientists fanning out across Antarctica

1
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,379
and many are focused on the same

1
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:57,588
question Kota Antarctica be headed for a

1
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,380
meltdown over here is Mount Boreas we're

1
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:01,549
gonna have a lot of scientists working

1
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:03,139
together there is a little bit of

1
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:05,389
volcanic ash and you know challenging

1
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:06,710
each other's theories challenging what

1
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,210
we know but if that as a community we're

1
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,720
gonna find the answers

1
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,778
you

1
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,719
but the continent won't give up its

1
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,439
secrets easily the stark beauty of

1
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:25,458
Antarctica masks a treacherous nature

1
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,078
more than seventy percent of all the

1
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,969
fresh water in the world is harbored

1
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:35,428
here but most of that water is frozen

1
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:39,269
and with less precipitation than the

1
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,389
Sahara Antarctica is the driest desert

1
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,730
on earth raging winds of up to 200 miles

1
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,600
per hour

1
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,759
sometimes blasts the frozen terrain

1
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,278
where temperatures can drop to a hundred

1
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,458
degrees below zero only during the short

1
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,678
Antarctic summer can most researchers

1
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:00,808
gather precious scientific data from

1
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:03,808
this giant mystery continent come to

1
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:06,288
light

1
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,560
that's all that and to me

1
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,208
for our flight and 400 miles for McMurdo

1
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,449
is the center of the West Antarctic Ice

1
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:26,740
Sheet and for one team this is the best

1
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,870
way to find out about the past this is a

1
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,518
side of a snow pit it's a thin wall

1
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,589
between two pits the other side is open

1
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,538
so they can light can shine through and

1
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:38,798
you can really see the different layers

1
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,038
in the pit so this is one year's worth

1
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:44,288
of snow accumulation and there's a

1
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:45,548
second year's worth of snow accumulation

1
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:48,548
here below it two years of record right

1
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:51,099
here in the snow pit of course we want

1
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:52,538
to go back a lot further in time than

1
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,669
that in order to do that we can't just

1
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,110
use shovels and chainsaws like we did

1
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:56,469
here

1
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,730
so we have to use a drill

1
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,899
ken Taylor's team is drilling through

1
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,900
ice their goal is to gather samples from

1
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,180
the nearly two mile thick West Antarctic

1
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,019
Ice Sheet and the deeper they go the

1
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:19,069
further back in time they travel here at

1
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,980
about 480 meters deep right now this is

1
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,420
right around the time when Jesus lived

1
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,660
it's right about zero ad right when BC

1
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,150
years turned into 80 years these ice

1
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,940
cores contain tiny bubbles of ancient

1
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,700
atmosphere that were trapped each year

1
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,580
as the snow was compressed into ice nice

1
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,919
bubbles in this one it's ancient area

1
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,660
there when we crush samples like this I

1
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,000
don't get the cows out there and we can

1
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,250
sample the ancient atmosphere

1
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,319
we can also get a record of how things

1
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,970
like temperature and sea ice changed in

1
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,038
the past by combining these different

1
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,079
records we can understand how the

1
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,819
climate system is operating the past

1
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:04,329
but the ice work valuable as it is only

1
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:06,369
goes back about eight hundred thousand

1
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:09,750
years a tiny fraction of geologic time

1
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,099
to get a more complete picture of

1
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,428
Antarctica's climate history you have to

1
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:18,040
drill farther back in time and that's

1
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,129
what the andreal team is trying to do

1
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,240
they want to paint a picture of

1
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,519
Antarctica as it changed from warm to

1
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:27,910
cold millions of years ago in order to

1
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,509
do that

1
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,609
andr will have to drill deep into the

1
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:33,279
earth but finding the right location is

1
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,529
a major challenge on a continent covered

1
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:38,379
by ice and even in those few places

1
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,230
where the ice has receded it's still not

1
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,319
easy and rills David Harwood and Richard

00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,558
levy are searching for places to drill

1
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,389
but as they fly over a field of rubble

1
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,460
they see the gathering evidence for a

1
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,039
chronological history is not possible

1
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,950
here something has stirred things up and

1
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,090
that something is the ice itself that's

1
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:04,689
because ice moves for tens of millions

1
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,029
of years glaciers have slowly scoured

1
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:09,129
the land gobbling up rocks and debris

1
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,200
and spreading them all across the

1
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,929
landscape in random order this we call

1
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,460
glacial paleontology some call it

1
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,259
garbage pile paleontology because we're

1
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,339
looking and sorting through these

1
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,558
Marines to try to get pieces of

1
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:21,789
information that the ice sheet has

1
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:24,339
brought to us a marine is the chaotic

1
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:25,990
accumulation of rocks and debris

1
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,660
deposited by glacial movement this one

1
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,500
here she has abundant shell fossils this

1
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,019
shell brought here by a glacier comes

1
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,519
from a time when the continent was

1
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,519
warmer and water ran through these

1
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,849
valleys this landscape is a treasure

1
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:46,149
trove of a Nordica's climate history but

1
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,419
the ice has scrambled all the clues

1
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,340
we're looking at a jigsaw puzzle yet

1
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,959
there's one place where the evidence

1
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,990
remains intact that's in the seafloor

1
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,750
beneath the Antarctic ice shelf where

1
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,058
the glacial movement has also deposited

1
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:04,269
layer after layer in chronological order

1
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:07,058
drilling gives us an opportunity to get

1
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,210
a serial history in time each layer goes

1
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,210
back in time and we know that a rock

1
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,069
was younger than a rock below so we

1
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,829
could put it into history the andrel

1
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:18,778
team aims to drill through the Antarctic

1
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,950
ice and the sea below then like a straw

1
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,139
thrust through a layer cake they'll bore

1
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:27,479
deep into the ocean floor in order to

1
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,610
recover millions of years of rock and

1
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,979
mud the trace Antarctica's climate

1
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,470
history even after ice began to form in

1
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,899
Antarctica around 34 million years ago

1
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,329
the continent remained warm enough for

1
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:45,569
plant life to survive a lot like areas

1
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:48,450
of New Zealand today where ice can be

1
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,929
found bordered by trees and plants but

1
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,419
when did Antarctica plunge into a solid

1
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,240
deep freeze and how did it happen

1
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,220
was it gradual or abrupt

1
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,739
will the story of how Antarctica changed

1
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,139
from green house to ice house reveal new

1
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:07,969
clues about the continents climate

1
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:14,569
future and our own Charlie I am David

1
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:17,200
Harwood

1
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,470
the andrel team will spend the next few

1
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,480
weeks searching for drilling locations

1
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,920
from the surface of the ice but David

1
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,680
Harwood remains focused on what lies

1
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,080
below when I'm driving across there I'm

1
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,220
always thinking about what's beneath

1
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,890
this I'm over about 15 feet of ice and

1
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,280
over that I'm over about 1,500 feet of

1
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,680
water and then the sediments below that

1
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,720
here at the bottom of the world the Sun

1
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,480
never sets in the summer and his night

1
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,839
blends in today the work begins in

1
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,750
earnest the team heads out to McMurdo

1
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,180
Sound a place where the ocean freezes

1
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,210
annually creating a precarious platform

1
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,759
of floating sea ice that will only last

1
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,180
a few months we're standing right now in

1
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,150
the southern part of the proto Sound

1
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,670
seasonally this region will break out

1
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,070
the sea ice that are standing on the

1
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,279
melt out it's now strong enough perhaps

1
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,920
20 feet beneath us is a thickness of ice

1
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,560
and then 15 hundred feet of water

1
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,740
beneath us as well just to be sure

1
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,809
they're in the right place fire in the

1
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:38,619
hole the team blasts powerful sound

1
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,849
waves through the sea ice

1
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,350
and into the sea floor below the result

1
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:49,230
is a sonic street map of layer after

1
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,079
layer of rock and mud each one

1
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,388
representing a different era of the past

1
00:23:56,778 --> 00:24:00,179
by looking in the past we can may be

1
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,509
projecting to the future how dynamic has

1
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,250
been the behavior of the ice sheets have

1
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:05,849
they been static

1
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:09,839
and slowly changing act of a player have

1
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,109
they been

1
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,600
finally it's time to tow the giant drill

1
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:24,829
out onto the ice to ensure that the

1
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,809
weight of the rig isn't supported by the

1
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,799
sea ice alone

1
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:33,379
divers attach flotation devices to the

1
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,110
drill pipe and at the end of that pipe

1
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,899
is a whirling tool with a unique cutting

1
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,740
edge a drill bit made of diamonds that

1
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,660
can bore through almost everything in

1
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,930
its pad the diamond core system that we

1
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,299
have it's almost like melting the core

1
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:52,309
down through the rocks just cuts through

1
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,710
whatever's there if you hit a big

1
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,819
boulder you'll just end up with a

1
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:57,799
cylinder of that Boulder but it just

1
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:04,059
keep going now the real drilling begins

1
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:10,869
there's not a minute to waste because

1
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:12,939
the Antarctic research season is so

1
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,390
short

1
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,079
the crews work around the clock

1
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,019
to recover cores of rock the trace

1
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,759
Antarctica's ancient past

1
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,150
the powerful drill bores down over

1
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,880
three-quarters of a mile

1
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,180
bringing up 12 feet of core at a time

1
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,700
each foot averaging a thousand years of

1
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,519
climate history

1
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,190
it's an astonishing feat it's quite

1
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,140
amazing when you think about where we

1
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,570
are and what we're doing we've got a

1
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:55,389
drill rig a 60 ton 290 ton with all the

1
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,009
equipment on a drill rig sitting behind

1
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:00,250
us here on eight meters of sea ice above

1
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,410
380 meters of water and then we're

1
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,759
drilling down into the sea floor below

1
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,529
there with a three to four inch diameter

1
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,299
pipe that's turning round and round like

1
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,309
a a piece of spaghetti hanging down

1
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:10,629
through the water and into the ground

1
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,000
and it's wobbling around a bit and we're

1
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,190
turning around and bringing Cora from

1
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,980
deep within the earth anything can go

1
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,779
wrong at any minute with this process

1
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:26,289
and all too soon it does sometimes even

1
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:28,480
a drill bit made of diamonds can run

1
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
into trouble we haven't been getting

1
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,940
particularly good quality core and we're

1
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,440
suspecting that the drill bit has been

1
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,009
damaged in places it's a little bit

1
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:41,319
narrower it should be for the size of

1
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:44,019
the diamond bits and that means we have

1
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,900
to pull our pipe out about 1700 meters

1
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,110
and replace a bit

1
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,329
right back down the hole and that's

1
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:55,029
going to take us about 24 hours to 36

1
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:58,690
hours removing and replacing nearly a

1
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,420
mile of pipe is no easy task especially

1
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,298
when it's your job to change it all out

1
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:09,490
piece by piece but for other members of

1
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:24,099
the andrel team it's a welcome break in

1
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:26,490
an extreme environment like Antarctica

1
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,890
nobody's on a diet your body is working

1
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,640
so hard to stay warm packing away 6,000

1
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,070
calories or more a day is not an

1
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:39,899
indulgence it's a necessity

1
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:43,690
and because Antarctica is drier than the

1
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,350
hottest desert dehydration is a constant

1
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:52,240
concern and keeping the drill up and

1
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,440
running is another

1
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:03,148
finally after a day and a half of hard

1
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,258
work the new bid is in place and

1
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:12,750
drilling is back on track they recover a

1
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,509
12-foot length of core wrapped in a

1
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:18,509
protective cover workers carefully carry

1
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:21,360
it back to the lab to be examined when

1
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,699
they crack it open it's in perfect

1
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,298
condition this mud and rock is more

1
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:30,839
valuable than gold because each core is

1
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,269
a time machine we're currently down to

1
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:36,450
the depth of body 440 meters that's

1
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,298
about a quarter mile down corresponding

1
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:41,638
to a time at least 15 million years ago

1
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:48,928
when Antarctica was still warm as the

1
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:52,110
cores are recovered each section is

1
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:56,939
sliced lengthwise x-rayed and scanned in

1
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,600
labs at the drill site and back at

1
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,298
McMurdo this course came out of the

1
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:04,679
ground three days ago they were split

1
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,149
yesterday they were imaged yesterday

1
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:07,859
sedimentology stew worked the night

1
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:10,168
shift 12 hours describing these pours

1
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,330
millimeter by millimeter looking at the

1
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,939
color size ratios any kind of structure

1
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,009
they see in a core trying to understand

1
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:20,220
how these sediments were deposited each

1
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,769
core tells a story depending on its

1
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:26,819
texture color and contents and some of

1
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:28,980
those stories are spectacular we're

1
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,230
seeing some macro fossils some large

1
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,870
shells these shells are evidence of

1
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:36,898
warmer times even as Antarctica is icing

1
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:38,579
up this is one the most particular

1
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:41,099
fossil found within and really decision

1
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:43,980
this is a scallop now this kind of

1
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,399
scalloped simply do not live in extreme

1
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:49,859
polar waters

1
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,678
and there are other clues

1
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,250
some of them nearly invisible hidden

1
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,798
inside these cores are shells of

1
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,519
microscopic algae called diatoms for

1
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,859
Andrew climate detectives these tiny

1
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:08,558
diatoms create a highly revealing

1
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,349
picture of the past because not all

1
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:14,469
diatoms are alike some species are

1
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,110
adapted to colder conditions while

1
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:20,798
others flourish in warmer waters we use

1
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,200
them as biological markers index of

1
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,909
different environmental conditions cold

1
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:27,730
or warm frozen waters or open ocean

1
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,210
waters again the andrel team examines

1
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,808
cores from around 15 million years ago

1
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:37,269
they find smooth green sands containing

1
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,669
diatoms that thrived in relatively warm

1
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,720
water confirming this was a time before

1
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,269
antarctica finally froze over this is

1
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:49,569
very well-defined warm period iceberg

1
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:52,509
free waters open waters where diatoms

1
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:54,308
are growing and thriving you can see

1
00:30:54,308 --> 00:30:56,609
this persistent for quite some time a

1
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:59,199
picture is beginning to form of a long

1
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,528
period of transition starting 34 million

1
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,259
years ago when a cooling climate led to

1
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:07,990
the formation of ice but even so

1
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,440
conditions remained relatively mild but

1
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,808
when did Antarctica finally slip into a

1
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:18,970
deep freeze the answer lies in cores

1
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,720
from around 14 million years ago

1
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,850
instead of smooth and green these cores

1
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:29,000
are rocky and gray and some contain

1
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,490
diatoms that thrived in cold glacial

1
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,000
waters this amazing discovery reveals a

1
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,880
rapid change from cool to frozen it

1
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,070
fills in what has always been a blank

1
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,480
page in Antarctica's climate history

1
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,069
next season they'll attack another

1
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,909
crucial question after Antarctica froze

1
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,000
14 million years ago did the ice ever

1
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,089
melt or has it remained a frozen

1
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:02,619
wilderness right up until today that

1
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:06,489
answer will have to wait

1
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,699
cracks in the sea-ice tell the team it's

1
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,580
time to return to base we've seen the

1
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:16,069
ice break in quite a bit in the last

1
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,079
month but it's not broken in anywhere

1
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,119
anywhere further south than it is right

1
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,839
now we can only be on this site for so

1
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,849
long before the sea ice starts to melt

1
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,678
before the conditions change and for

1
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,120
safety reasons we have to get off the

1
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,219
sea ice the precarious sea ice of West

1
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,798
Antarctica may come and go with the

1
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,859
seasons but what about the giant East

1
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:43,909
Antarctic Ice Sheet a mountain of ice so

1
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:48,798
high it covers mountains this is like an

1
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,410
MRI of the ice sheet some places it's

1
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,750
really thick two miles thick and pretty

1
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,970
flat and boring but then there are other

1
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,490
places where what we discovered were

1
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,710
hidden mountain ranges the size of the

1
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,798
Appalachians but totally hidden by the

1
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:07,789
huge you said Artic ice sheet there's

1
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:10,789
ten times as much ice in the east as in

1
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,210
the west but a small portion of the East

1
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,490
has almost no ice at all

1
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,980
it's an unearthly location that defies

1
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,720
the very image of Antarctica

1
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,139
these are the Dry Valleys cold barren

1
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:42,398
and except for a few scientists almost

1
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,608
completely devoid of life the landscape

1
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,908
is so alien nASA has used it as a test

1
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:56,659
site for space programs it's a fantastic

1
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,629
place you can't find this anywhere else

1
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:00,138
on earth

1
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,048
it's closest analogue is the surface of

1
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:08,628
Mars Mullins Valley is the ultimate

1
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:12,980
remote field camp it serves as home base

1
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,500
for a pioneering band of glaciologists

1
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,449
led by Dave Marchand

1
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,909
Marsh aunt and his team are conducting

1
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:31,710
research the rugged old-fashioned way

1
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,389
they'll live in tents and won't be

1
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,049
picked up for two months they need to be

1
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,180
self-sufficient and for the most part

1
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,869
they like it that way good day

1
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:51,579
burritos the good thing about working

1
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:53,590
out here is it's actually double-edged

1
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,450
sword you come out here you have no

1
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,250
contact with the outside world no email

1
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,199
no real telephone contacts so you can

1
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,669
totally immerse yourself in the science

1
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,980
and that allows you to think 24 hours a

1
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,539
day about what you're doing the other

1
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,130
side of that is you have no idea what's

1
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,890
going on outside right beginning of the

1
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:11,019
season I didn't like it when there you

1
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:12,369
would breathe and the frost would form

1
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:14,289
on the outside of the sleeping bag but

1
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:16,300
it hold up now and it's a little more

1
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,060
comfortable and a lot easier small

1
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,789
setups like we have which are helicopter

1
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,860
supported are isolated they're among the

1
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,260
most isolated in the region and as a

1
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,850
result we have to check in daily with

1
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:32,110
McMurdo I'll try to heat the batteries

1
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,789
up so that we can get a signal out right

1
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:37,029
now there appears to be no satellite

1
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,790
coverage and the batter is a little bit

1
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:42,779
cold so I'm trying to warm it up

1
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,769
sometimes you have to contort your body

1
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:50,110
in various ways to get the signal no not

1
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:56,680
we don't have enough signal yet well

1
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,969
here we go we've got something that

1
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:58,659
might work

1
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,799
Mac ops this is gone for Mullins Valley

1
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,750
we have seven on board and all as well

1
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:10,800
over are we lost transmission

1
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:14,509
this valley holds an incredible record

1
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,540
this area is so dry and so cold that the

1
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:20,000
landscape is pristine the rocks we see

1
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,769
here are millions of years old more

1
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,239
shock believes that little has changed

1
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,279
here for millions of years what to me is

1
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,840
exciting is that we're walking on an

1
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,170
ancient landscape imagine living ten

1
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,940
million years ago in Antarctica this is

1
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,159
what you'd see exactly as it is today

1
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,359
hardly modified at all

1
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,019
but when marshawn's team drilled beneath

1
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:52,969
this rubble they found something totally

1
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,149
unexpected

1
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:59,340
a hidden glacier that extends hundreds

1
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,240
of feet below the surface this is in my

1
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,969
opinion the oldest dated berry glacier

1
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:11,909
on earth the evidence comes from

1
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:14,730
volcanic ash the dry valleys are

1
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,949
surrounded by extinct volcanoes that

1
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:19,559
erupted millions of years ago we're

1
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:22,619
finding ash deposits on top of ice ash

1
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,329
dates are coming back as old as 8

1
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:27,230
million years and according to more shot

1
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,420
this volcanic ash shows this hidden

1
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,840
glacier once frozen has never melted

1
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,570
this volcanic ash that erupted from a

1
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,039
volcano and has been sitting there for

1
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,619
millions of years it shows no chemical

1
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,239
alteration which you'd expect if there

1
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,129
were any amount of liquid meltwater over

1
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,970
that duration the fact that it's dry and

1
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:50,159
pristine tells me it's always been here

1
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:56,099
which is incredible equally astonishing

1
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,889
and just three hundred miles away there

1
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:00,359
appears to be a completely different

1
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,710
picture exploring East Antarctica closer

1
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,590
to the South Pole and riyals David

1
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,230
Harwood found leaf fossils and pieces of

1
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,250
wood surprisingly according to Harwood

1
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,949
these date to a relatively recent time

1
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:19,679
when Antarctica was not only warmer than

1
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,549
today there were plants and trees this

1
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,100
is a piece of southern beach this wood

1
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,619
is not fossilized in the sense that it

1
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,559
is petrified it could still burn to find

1
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,880
the wood and leaves together

1
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,740
it is pretty phenomenal it's really

1
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,539
phenomenal for Antarctica particularly

1
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:39,449
for Antarctica in the in this time

1
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:42,829
period about 4 million years ago

1
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,119
this season the drill is setup to find

1
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,099
evidence of what happened in Antarctica

1
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,859
during this period three to five million

1
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:56,639
years ago it's a time known as the

1
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,368
Pliocene now what's important about that

1
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:03,210
is that the Pliocene was globally warmer

1
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,789
than today the same temperatures as our

1
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:07,950
earth may be headed for at the end of

1
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,389
the century if climate change

1
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,028
predictions are correct if we go back

1
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:14,068
three to five million years into the

1
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:16,768
geological past we know that there was a

1
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,389
time when Earth's climate was warmer

1
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,318
than it is today

1
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:23,130
perhaps by 3 to 4 degrees so it's the

1
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,200
best example we have of where the

1
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,788
climate is heading in the next hundred

1
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:27,210
years

1
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,210
the drills new location is on the giant

1
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,088
Ross Ice Shelf which extends out and

1
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:34,349
over the ocean

1
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:37,200
it's the largest ice shelf in the world

1
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,858
and it helps hold back the massive

1
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:42,119
Antarctic Ice Sheet

1
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,420
from flowing into the sea these ice

1
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,249
shelves are very important what they do

1
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:50,548
is hold back the flow of ice that's

1
00:39:50,548 --> 00:39:52,199
actually trying to flow out into the

1
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:55,618
ocean we call that buttressing if

1
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,960
warming oceans cause the Ross Ice Shelf

1
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,170
to break up and melt into the sea the

1
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,059
West Antarctic Ice Sheet would

1
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:06,289
eventually follow right behind

1
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,690
the andrel team is looking for the

1
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,269
answer to a critical question when Earth

1
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:17,239
was warming during the Pliocene what

1
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:20,089
happened to the ice did the Ross Ice

1
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,059
Shelf melt taking the giant ice sheets

1
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:27,320
with it drilling on an ice shelf brings

1
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,720
with it a unique set of technological

1
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,379
challenges

1
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,600
including constant problems with mud and

1
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,049
water

1
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:43,940
unlike drilling through sea ice which is

1
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,869
just 26 feet thick the ice shelf here is

1
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:50,569
400 feet we're looking at at least

1
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,600
doubling or trying to double our

1
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,679
capability below the sea floor and

1
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,779
penetrate 2,000 meters or better into

1
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,120
the sea floor but that's only the

1
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:04,219
beginning no one has ever drilled

1
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,259
through an ice shelf and they present

1
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,480
these challenges the ice shelves they

1
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,429
float up and down with the tide so

1
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,569
you've got to deal with this vertical

1
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,390
elevation change they move sideways they

1
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,389
flow so eventually your drill pipe is

1
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:20,269
going to get bent can the drill bore

1
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,219
through a thick layer of ice that's

1
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:24,709
constantly moving without breaking or

1
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,039
getting yanked out of the sea floor to

1
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,900
confront this unique challenge head-on

1
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,980
the Android team invents a new tool a

1
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,650
hot-water drill this marvel of

1
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,539
engineering is a moving ring of heat

1
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:41,360
that blasts jets of steaming water to

1
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,099
melt a wide hole so the drill can

1
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:45,739
operate freely through four hundred feet

1
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:49,399
of shifting ice and once again time is

1
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,769
so precious the team must work around

1
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:54,829
the clock not only retrieving cores but

1
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:58,400
also analyzing them it's 2:00 a.m. but

1
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,039
you wouldn't know it geologists are busy

1
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:03,219
logging cores like it's early afternoon

1
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:05,750
we're laying out the cores and a proper

1
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,269
sequence from top grade highest point in

1
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:09,710
the core all the way to the very slowest

1
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,990
point of the quarter an 80-foot core

1
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:13,699
that dates back about three million

1
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:17,929
years is closely examined it contains

1
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:20,299
micro fossils of single-celled animals

1
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,560
known as forums

1
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,309
they're from the crucial warm period

1
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:31,190
called the Pliocene and these tiny

1
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,099
shells are precise indicators of ocean

1
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:37,099
temperature these guys are about the

1
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,860
size of a grain of sand because the same

1
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,890
species lived through time we can use

1
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:45,139
the chemistry of modern examples to

1
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:47,629
allow us to calibrate if you like the

1
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:58,519
chemistry of the ancient examples what

1
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:01,250
Gabe's doing here is he's measuring the

1
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,320
amount of two metals magnesium and

1
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,480
calcium that are in the ocean and get

1
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,929
incorporated into the shell of the 4m

1
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:10,129
when it's growing in that ocean and that

1
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,099
process is dependent on the temperature

1
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,049
of the ocean so if we know the magnesium

1
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,300
we know the calcium we can determine the

1
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,310
temperature of the ocean at the time

1
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:21,730
that forum lived and because of that

1
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,170
Andrew researchers can now calculate

1
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,510
Antarctic water temperatures during the

1
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,880
Pliocene what this is telling us as

1
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,349
temperatures were three to four perhaps

1
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:33,589
five degrees above prison

1
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,900
even just one degree rise notion

1
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,760
temperatures in the waters surrounding

1
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,210
Antarctica will attack and begin to melt

1
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,340
the ice shelves from below

1
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,829
very quickly the air temperatures will

1
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,840
stay cold enough to keep things frozen

1
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,610
at the surface but what we're worried

1
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,140
about is the ice being attacked from

1
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:57,029
beneath not from above and the cores

1
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,950
revealed that this is what happened

1
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:01,289
during the Pliocene when global climate

1
00:44:01,289 --> 00:44:04,320
was warming but they display even more

1
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,110
change than expected revealing not only

1
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,900
a patchwork of glacial rubble but also

1
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,079
smooth mud from open seas indicating

1
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,989
that ice both froze and then melted many

1
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:19,229
times there's a really important change

1
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,230
right here this involves us quite a

1
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,110
dramatic change in the environment there

1
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,660
was ice and then there was no ice the

1
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:29,039
ice shade has gone backwards and

1
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,570
forwards it's advanced and it's

1
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,510
retreated as they examine core after

1
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,150
core from the Pliocene they continue to

1
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,360
see surprising signs of change the

1
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,190
results of the drilling are simply

1
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,849
spectacular they give us a picture of a

1
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,759
dynamic ice sheet coming and going

1
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,950
regularly more than 60 times what we're

1
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:54,599
seeing and this record is telling us

1
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,579
that Antarctica's not just a benign

1
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,150
spectator

1
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:02,019
it's a playa what this means is while it

1
00:45:02,018 --> 00:45:04,118
was generally warm during the Pliocene

1
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,818
there were also brief periods of cooling

1
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:09,639
and the ice was exquisitely sensitive to

1
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,848
even small changes in climate just a few

1
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:15,150
degrees could tip the scale from ice to

1
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,019
no ice so what's in store for our future

1
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:23,889
as Earth continues to warm how much

1
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:26,949
Antarctic ice will melt and how high

1
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:31,509
will sea levels rise and rule scientists

1
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,880
turned to computer models by Rob de

1
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:40,568
canto and Dave Pollard we developed

1
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:43,389
these climate models based on our best

1
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:45,009
understanding of the physics of the

1
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,108
climate system and in this case ice

1
00:45:47,108 --> 00:45:51,400
sheets and now information from anvil is

1
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,400
added to the climate model this is a

1
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,499
computer model simulation of the

1
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:58,058
Antarctic Ice Sheet over the last

1
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:01,089
several million years and covers a good

1
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:02,858
chunk of the interval that was recovered

1
00:46:02,858 --> 00:46:04,900
by the andrel sediment core so we're

1
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,028
looking for the same kind of behavior in

1
00:46:07,028 --> 00:46:09,309
our models that we're seeing in the

1
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,798
geological record as the model simulates

1
00:46:11,798 --> 00:46:15,068
the warming periods of the Pliocene all

1
00:46:15,068 --> 00:46:18,759
of the ice shelves disappear followed by

1
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:21,489
the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet and

1
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:25,690
edges of the east and as temperatures

1
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,690
change the ice refreezes and melts again

1
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:32,440
and again and that's important because

1
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,989
the changes in the ice sheet that we're

1
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,809
seeing here reflect pretty significant

1
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:40,980
changes in sea level

1
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:44,220
according to the cantos model sea levels

1
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,969
rose about 23 feet during the Pliocene

1
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:49,048
temperatures back then were three to

1
00:46:49,048 --> 00:46:52,318
five degrees higher than now just what's

1
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:53,730
projected to take place

1
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,960
by the end of the century but there is a

1
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,449
lag time in the way ice responds that

1
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,029
may delay the impact for hundreds if not

1
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,540
thousands of years

1
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:08,308
regardless coastal cities all over the

1
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:11,160
world would be at risk potentially

1
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:14,460
displacing millions we would be

1
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,659
remapping places like Boston in New York

1
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:21,719
the Bay Area not to mention of course

1
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:25,230
places like Louisiana Miami New Orleans

1
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,260
of course but even that might not be the

1
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,950
worst-case scenario

1
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,430
things were very similar to today in

1
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:39,589
terms of our climate

1
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,510
Tim Nations robbed a Kanto to New

1
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,700
Zealand to look at a possibility that's

1
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:47,519
even more frightening this is the first

1
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,230
time I've seen the actual direct

1
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,119
evidence for what the models are doing

1
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,059
you seeing a deepening syllable rise up

1
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:59,429
through here we're going to look at some

1
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:02,129
rocks set at the same age as rocks look

1
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,470
drilled and Antarctica that give us the

1
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:12,149
record of global sea level changes here

1
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,670
along the ranga tiki river tectonic

1
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,980
forces have raised the land and the

1
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,349
river has cut into the earth to expose

1
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:22,049
layer after layer of sediment that once

1
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:27,240
was the sea floor what they find our

1
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,399
shells dated to the warming era of the

1
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,579
Pliocene these shells provide a way to

1
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,250
chart sea level in the past because some

1
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,250
of these species still exist today many

1
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,869
of these Shoals you see in here actually

1
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:41,699
live today so they live around the

1
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:43,949
coastline and we know the water depth

1
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:46,980
they live in today so by breaking them

1
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,900
out of these rocks and identifying them

1
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,150
we can say the depth they were living

1
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,809
here over three million years ago

1
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:56,460
because these shellfish live on the

1
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,679
seafloor and can only survive in water

1
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:02,009
at specific depths they suggest that sea

1
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,990
levels in the Pliocene were much higher

1
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:07,219
than even the computer models predict

1
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:09,949
this is really a troll

1
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:12,139
this is where we would say we had the

1
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:14,690
evidence for sea level being up to as

1
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,269
much as 20 meters about Britain that's

1
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:22,250
over 60 feet in order for sea level to

1
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,829
arisen that high an enormous amount of

1
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:28,429
ice must have melted and this raises a

1
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:31,519
startling possibility that a large part

1
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:33,579
of the vast East Antarctic Ice Sheet

1
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:37,819
melted along with the West and if it

1
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,830
melted once could it melt again that

1
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:45,170
could be a very bad thing because that

1
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,720
would actually produce a contribution to

1
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,579
future sea level change that we really

1
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:53,960
haven't been thinking about this

1
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,449
presents an even more dangerous and

1
00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:01,179
unpredictable picture of Antarctica

1
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:06,000
what's been surprising is even

1
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,309
geologists thought that glaciers and ice

1
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:10,470
sheets were these large static features

1
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:12,629
which we would never really see change

1
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,809
in our lifetime but glacial processes

1
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:18,480
are no longer quite as glacial things

1
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,039
are moving faster than we had thought

1
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:25,170
what's driving these changes are rising

1
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:28,559
levels of greenhouse gases in the next

1
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,349
five years greenhouse gas levels will be

1
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:33,990
like they were in the Pliocene but we're

1
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,328
not just going back to the Pliocene some

1
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:39,079
of the projections put co2 levels at

1
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:42,568
twice the concentrations of the Pliocene

1
00:50:42,568 --> 00:50:45,509
by the end of the next century we're

1
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,339
essentially going back to the time of

1
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:49,139
the dinosaurs when there was very little

1
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:52,230
ice on the planet and there were forests

1
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,710
covering Antarctica and signs of change

1
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:59,099
are already here scientists were

1
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,470
completely caught by surprise when in

1
00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:04,469
2002 the Larsen Ice Shelf shattered

1
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:07,108
apart without warning in just a few

1
00:51:07,108 --> 00:51:11,730
weeks and today the Wilkins Ice Shelf a

1
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,130
block of ice approximately the size of

1
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:17,970
Connecticut barely hangs on I would say

1
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:19,889
it's inevitable that Western occur will

1
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:23,159
disappear how long it will take you

1
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:25,048
start occur to engage is something

1
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:27,630
that's that's not yet known in the

1
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,608
coming years the Andhra team will

1
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:32,130
continue to explore Antarctica's climate

1
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,318
history in order to gain valuable

1
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:37,139
insight into Earth's future with each

1
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:39,838
new core we gain new knowledge about a

1
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:42,088
continent that's always been shrouded in

1
00:51:42,088 --> 00:51:45,808
mystery but it's faith remains very much

1
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:49,460
tied to our own

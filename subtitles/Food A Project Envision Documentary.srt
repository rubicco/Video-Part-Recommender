1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:13,679
VOICES: There are some companies
that slaughter thousands of animals.

1
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,070
Because it is much more expensive
to produce beef without hormones.

1
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,579
Consumer's buy with their eyes.

1
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:26,179
Can't buy an orange that's unpeeled.

1
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,660
JOANNE FARYON (Host): Hello everyone.

1
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,870
I'm Joanne Faryon.

1
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,370
Welcome to this Envision
San Diego special "Food."

1
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,829
It's something we take for granted.

1
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,579
After all, California is the largest
supplier of food for the country.

1
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:46,909
Grocery store aisles are stocked with
just about anything we care to buy.

1
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:52,769
Chicken for less than a dollar a pound,
steaks the size of a dinner plate,

1
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,790
every species of fish and fruit and
vegetables no matter the season.

1
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,070
It may seem as though the cost of
these groceries continue to rise,

1
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,079
but we actually spend less money on our
food then we did a couple generations ago.

1
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,819
Just how all of this food makes
its way to the grocery store

1
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:15,579
and your dinner plate is the
subject of tonight's investigation.

1
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:21,769
We'll also tell you why it's relatively
cheap to buy beef, chicken even fish.

1
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,200
Some of it you may not want to know,

1
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,159
but at the end of the program we hope
you walk away a better informed consumer.

1
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:48,090
40 million pounds of San Diego oranges are on
their way to countries as far away as China.

1
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,250
13,000 head of cattle are being
fattened in Imperial Valley.

1
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,239
One in five will be slaughtered
for sale in Japan,

1
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,140
the others distributed across the country.

1
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,950
In Mission Bay, scientists are trying
to figure out what to feed farmed fish.

1
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,650
Those cattle you just saw,
well, they could be on the menu.

1
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,530
The food chain doesn't look like it use to.

1
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,569
Fish no longer eat fish, cattle eat
corn even though it can make them sick,

1
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,900
chickens eat fish and fish are eating cows.

1
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,659
Even chicken feathers become food.

1
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:27,400
We grow oranges but send them away
because they're too hard for us to peel;

1
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,330
the ones we eat come from Australia.

1
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:37,610
Just how did it get to be this
way, and is it good for us?

1
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,190
Tonight we look at the food we eat from the
dinner plate to the farm, field and ocean.

1
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:48,490
And how our demand for cheap food and
more food has altered the food chain.

1
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,050
A food chain that is motivated by
making the greatest amount of food

1
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,520
for the cheapest cost, in
other words, efficiency.

1
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:13,199
Americans consume nearly 20 percent of
all the beef in the world but only make

1
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,009
up about 5 percent of the world's population.

1
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:21,500
In 2008, the U.S. slaughtered
more than 34 million cattle,

1
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,520
slightly more than the year before.

1
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,460
So we followed the chain.

1
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:36,659
And what we found was a fast-growing,
corn-fed, hormone and antibiotic-injected animal

1
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:50,669
that likely traveled thousands of
miles before it ended up at your table.

1
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:58,879
And most of the 1.4 million dairy cows are
also destined for your table as hamburger.

1
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,889
Let's start at the beginning.

1
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:06,039
In southern California, most cattle start
out like this, eating grass on a pasture.

1
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,250
JIM DAVIS (President SD Imperial Valley
Cattleman's Association): In the '40s and '50s

1
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,770
when my grandfather was running cattle here
he would basically sell his cattle as two

1
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:21,759
or three-year-olds that would both be
taken to market here in San Diego County

1
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,089
and then distributed here in San Diego County.

1
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,929
FARYON: It doesn't work that way anymore.

1
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,730
Now, cattle are raised on grass for
six months, then sold at auction

1
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,730
to another rancher usually out of state.

1
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,660
We don't have enough grass or rain
to feed all our cattle year-round.

1
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,780
Once they're sold they'll live
another six months on grass.

1
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,069
They'll be sold again.

1
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:46,939
This time they go to a feedlot.

1
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,410
Large pens where cattle are sent to be
fattened before they're slaughtered.

1
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,310
This one in Imperial Valley
houses 13,000 animals.

1
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,550
It's considered small.

1
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,889
Some are home to more than 100,000 animals.

1
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,939
Cattle spend four or five months here.

1
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,649
They're fed mostly corn.

1
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:16,299
The U.S. introduced cattle into feedlots and
corn into their diets after World War II.

1
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,250
Both had a dramatic effect.

1
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,540
The animals grew faster and fatter.

1
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,980
Broc Sandelin is an animal sciences
professor at Cal Poly Pomona

1
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,509
and a third generation cattle rancher.

1
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,089
FARYON: Is there any research that says
they have a tough time digesting corn?

1
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:36,979
BROC SANDELIN: I'm not familiar with any I'm not
a nutritionist so I don't really know for sure

1
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,340
but I'm sure you could find something
or I could find something for you.

1
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,199
FARYON: Is it easier for them to
digest grass rather then corn?

1
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,620
SANDELIN: Yeah that's what they're
naturally raised on is grass.

1
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,180
FARYON: Studies have suggested corn-fed
cattle may harbor more virulent strains

1
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,730
of E. coli then grass fed
beef, although a new study

1
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,800
out of Kansas State University is
now challenging that assertion.

1
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,520
Feedlots have also led to
wider use of antibiotics.

1
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,789
And almost all the beef you buy in the grocery
store comes from cattle injected with hormones.

1
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,680
BILL BRANDENBERG: It is much more
expensive to produce beef without hormones.

1
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,590
FARYON: Corn makes cattle fat.

1
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,750
Hormones give them more lean muscle tissue.

1
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,790
Bill Brandenberg says the cattle can
grow 10 percent bigger with hormones.

1
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,340
BRANDENBERG: And without hormones the cattle
is going to have a lot more fat in them

1
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,429
and they're going to produce a lot
more of those upper grades of beef.

1
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,459
FARYON: Don't they have more fat in
them because we're feeding them corn?

1
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:36,409
BRANDENBERG: It's a combination of the corn and
the fact that what the hormones actually do,

1
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:42,350
the animal produces different
ratios of estrogen and testosterone.

1
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,990
The hormone doesn't actually go into the
bloodstream per se but it causes the animal

1
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,800
to produce its own different level so
it maximizes the production of lean

1
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
and minimizes the production of fat.

1
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,819
FARYON: But if we didn't feed them corn,
isn't it the corn fed that give them the fat?

1
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,480
BRANDENBERG: Yes.

1
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,240
FARYON: So if we didn't feed them corn
they wouldn't necessarily need the hormones

1
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,750
to make less fat?

1
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,910
BRANDENBERG: Well you could do them grass fed
without implants,Ã‚ you'd have a product too

1
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,390
but it wouldn't taste near
as good as corn-fed beef.

1
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,829
That's what the consumer in the United
States like is the flavor that goes along

1
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,709
with tenderness that goes along with corn fed.

1
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,839
FARYON: American beef is banned in
Europe because of the use of hormones.

1
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,889
Shelton Murinda is an animal
sciences professor at Cal Poly Pomona.

1
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:35,639
SHELTON MURINDA: The Europeans were using
what I would call the precautionary principal

1
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,469
which simply indicates when there is not
enough scientific evidence it is better

1
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,560
to be on the safe side.

1
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,610
FARYON: Isn't it?

1
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,189
MURINDA: It is always better
to be on the safe side

1
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:50,300
when you do not have sufficient
scientific evidence.

1
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,470
FARYON: Well then why do we still use
hormones in beef in the United States?

1
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,080
MURINDA:The situation is rather different here.

1
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:04,459
There are pros and cons that
have been thrown about.

1
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:08,509
Some of them what I indicated:
the potential side affects.

1
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:15,360
From as far as I know, there has not been
enough risk assessment that has been done

1
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,430
with relevance to the side effects of those
hormones with respect to the human population.

1
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,340
Not enough research has been to
gather that sort of information

1
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,750
so there has been no risk
assessment that has been done.

1
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,200
FARYON: So why not go on the side
of caution like the Europeans?

1
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,940
MURINDA: We'd rather think differently here.

1
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,220
We'd rather think differently.

1
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,180
FARYON: So will any of these
cattle end up on your plate?

1
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:47,000
MURINDA: The chances of getting beef that's
from California is rather slim in other words,

1
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,419
most of it comes from outside California.

1
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,649
FARYON: The average American eats
about 17 pounds of fish per year.

1
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,750
Half the fish we eat is farmed fish.

1
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:04,250
That means the fish was born, raised
and fed in a net not far off the coast.

1
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,840
We wanted to know whether farmed fish
was as healthy as wild-caught fish.

1
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,980
The answer?

1
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,560
It all depends on what farmed fish eat.

1
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,769
And just wait until you hear
what we're feeding them.

1
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:21,470
DON KENT: I grew up in San Diego when San
Diego was the tuna capitol of the world you do

1
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,670
down to the embarcadero and tuna sainers
were tied up next to each other three deep

1
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:29,459
at the embarcadero and that's gone now.

1
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,509
FARYON: Don Kent is President of
Hubbs-Seaworld research Institute.

1
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:39,189
Here they're developing new ways to farm
fish, from the hatchery and now to your table.

1
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,950
Hubbs-Seaworld wants to establish the largest
fish farm off U.S. coastal waters five miles

1
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,890
west of Mission Bay.

1
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:52,889
Kent sees it as a boon to the local economy and
a way to take pressure of depleting fish stocks.

1
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:57,319
The debate over fish farming has
traditionally been about how to do it in a way

1
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,050
that doesn't contaminate local waters.

1
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:04,859
Hubbs believes by establishing nets five
miles off the coast where the water is deep

1
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,419
and the current swift, it can
minimize contamination concerns.

1
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,469
But there's another issue.

1
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,950
Fish also eat other fish.

1
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,390
If farmed fish are fed fish, the
practice could deplete dwindling stocks.

1
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:25,309
So the challenge is to find other sources of
fish food and fish oil to feed farmed fish.

1
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:30,959
JEFFREY GRAHAM: For every pound of growth for
a salmon it takes about five pounds of fish

1
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,600
that are caught and ground up and
turned into pellets or some kind

1
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,899
of feeding mechanism to give to these fish.

1
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,699
So five to one, that's a very stiff ratio.

1
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,030
What you're essentially doing
doing then is you're --

1
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,240
and part of the two-way street argument
that's given about acqueculture is well,

1
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,100
take pressure off the natural populations.

1
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,720
However, if you have to catch five pounds
of fish from the natural environment

1
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:07,220
to rear one pound of salmon, for high-end
table consumption the arithmetic doesn't work

1
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,310
out in terms of the long-term
benefits to the ocean.

1
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:15,259
KENT: There's a lot of experimentation going on
and we do it here on our species that's looking

1
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,879
to replace that fish meal
in the diet with soy protein

1
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:26,460
or other processing byproducts
like beef or chicken byproducts.

1
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,000
Basically waste in processing
that can be turned around and used

1
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,610
as a protein supplement to
replace the fish meal.

1
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,649
FARYON: According to the National Renderers
Association cow and chicken by products,

1
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,809
including cattle blood and
bone, and poultry feathers,

1
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,759
have been fed to farmed fish for decades.

1
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:52,299
The association told KPBS cattle fat, blood
and bone meal are being increasingly used

1
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:56,819
in fish diets as an alternatives
to fish oil and other proteins.

1
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,790
So by now you might be asking what we asked

1
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:05,889
when we learned fish were eating cattle
by-products: Can fish get mad cow disease?

1
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:13,110
Mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy
or BSE, is a neurodegenarative disease

1
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,480
in cattle that can be passed onto humans.

1
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,370
Eurpean countries have banned
cattle by products in fish feed

1
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:26,230
because if fish eat contaminated cattle
and cattle eat contaminated fish,

1
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,720
the disease in theory, can be
transmitted to the food chain.

1
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,830
Here in the U.S. the Food and
Drug Administration banned the use

1
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,000
of most cow by-products as
feed to other cows in 1997.

1
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,559
But the same rules do not apply to fish feed.

1
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:51,419
However, a new regulation does ban the use
of cattle brains and spines in fish feed;

1
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:57,349
both contain the highest concentrations
of infected material in diseased cattle.

1
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,639
There has never been a case of humans
contracting mad cow by eating farmed fish.

1
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,730
Meanwhile, there continues
to be an ongoing debate

1
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,590
over the omega-3 content
of farmed versus wild fish.

1
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,440
Omega-3s are the healthy fats that can
help prevent heart disease and Alzheimer's.

1
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,510
One large grocery chain claims on its Web site,

1
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,220
farmed salmon actually has
more omega-3 than wild salmon.

1
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,940
KPBS put their claim to the test and sent fish
samples, wild and farmed, to a lab in Oregon.

1
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,210
The tests results confirmed that farmed
salmon did have nearly twice the amount

1
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,320
of healthy omega-3s as wild salmon but you had

1
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,280
to eat nearly four times the amount
of fat to get those nutrients.

1
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,240
Americans eat more chicken than any other meat,

1
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,669
about 74 pounds per person each
year, and most of it is white meat.

1
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:57,129
Consumers like white meat and so the industry
has found a way to give us what we want.

1
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:05,610
CURTIS WOMACH: These are my fast-growing Cornish
cross and they're what's in the supermarkets,

1
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,409
all the restaurants sell this kind of chicken.

1
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:12,789
FARYON: Most of the chickens we buy in
a grocery store are called broilers --

1
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:17,169
a cross between two other chickens,
a Cornish and Plymouth Rock.

1
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:21,039
WOMACH: They're bred to grow really
fast and have lots of white meat,

1
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:27,110
see how wide it is, see the big breast?

1
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,090
FARYON: But none of these chickens
will end up in a grocery store.

1
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,560
Curtis Womach raises these chickens
on a farm just outside Julian.

1
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,439
Most chickens in a grocery store
are raised on a factory floor.

1
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,650
Womach sells his chickens at a farmers market.

1
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,679
He's decided he will no longer
raise this type of chicken.

1
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,789
WOMACH: Tthey can't physically mate
because of the white meat gets in the way.

1
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:56,730
They're still chickens and they want to
be like chickens but they can't move;

1
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,590
they would like to go under
the trees in the shade

1
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,420
but it's too hard for them to walk over there.

1
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,750
FARYON: The breasts are so big
these chickens can barely walk.

1
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,490
Look at these, a different breed and
able to run away from our camera.

1
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,490
Chickens are raised mostly on corn.

1
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,919
Fish meal can be added to their
feed -- even chicken feathers.

1
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,599
Antibiotics are used, but it's illegal
to use hormones in chickens in the U.S.

1
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,240
So when you see labels like
this, "no hormones added," well,

1
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,220
it's illegal to add hormones to all chicken.

1
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,389
In fact, it's against USDA regulations

1
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,899
to say no hormones have been
added unless this line follows.

1
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,500
See that line in small print?

1
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,379
And "natural"?

1
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:48,669
Well, just about all the food you buy is natural
unless something artificial has been injected.

1
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,419
And "fresh never been frozen"?

1
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:57,240
The legal definition according to the USDA of
fresh chicken means the internal temperature

1
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,680
of the chicken has never been
below 26 degrees farenheit.

1
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,089
"Free range"?

1
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,990
It doesn't mean your chicken
was raised like this.

1
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,320
It means the chicken had access to the outdoors.

1
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,790
But land to roam, time to grow, and feed like
this -- organic fruit -- comes with a price.

1
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:21,730
Womach's chickens cost about 20
dollars each compared to seven

1
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,039
or eight dollars for a grocery store chicken.

1
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,449
WOMACH: I think a lot of chicken is wasted.

1
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:34,710
If you're paying 60 cents a pound what does it
matter if you're not making stock from the bones

1
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,750
but I think there is an American
culture where it's

1
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,570
like we deserve all the meat we want everyday.

1
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:49,550
FARYON: Americans drink more orange
juice than any other fruit juice.

1
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:54,509
As KPBS reporter Amita Sharma
tells us, orange groves are part

1
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:58,129
of our history for the past 100 years.

1
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:04,910
AMITA SHARMA: San Diego County groves
produce 95,000 tons of oranges each year.

1
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,930
Local growers are sending these
oranges to India, China, Japan.

1
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,890
All countries willing to pay premium
rates for San Diego oranges viewed

1
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,710
as some of the tastiest in the world.

1
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,980
JOHN DEMSHKY: The color and taste of San
Diego fruit is quite popular overseas so most

1
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,640
of our San Diego fruit we
actually send to a foreign country.

1
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,650
SHARMA: Since we export most of our oranges,
thousands of miles away as far as Japan,

1
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,440
where do the oranges we eat come from?

1
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,549
It turns out, depending on the season, the
fruit we consume here is shipped from thousands

1
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:44,419
of miles away from countries like
Australia, South Africa and Peru.

1
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,140
It is we, the consumer, who've determined
that our oranges trot the globe.

1
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,660
American shoppers like their oranges
to be seedless and easy to peel.

1
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,070
But San Diego oranges have seeds and
their thinner skin is tougher to remove.

1
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:02,210
We also like our oranges to be orange.

1
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,600
DEMSHKY: Consumers buy with their eyes.

1
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,789
You can't buy an orange that's unpeeled.

1
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:10,990
But ultimately, that bright orange
color is really a factor of the climate

1
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,059
and temperatures they were grown in.

1
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:19,509
But clearly your San Diego fruit might
have had a little green on the top of it.

1
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:22,809
It's something "regreening" in the industry.

1
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,480
That's really just a cosmetic issue.

1
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,620
It's not an indication of the
flavor of the orange at all.

1
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:32,619
SHARMA: In fact, says 79-year-old Ben
Hillebrecht: HILLEBRECHT: They're sweet,

1
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:37,419
juicy and just an excellent orange.

1
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,080
SHARMA: Hillebrecht's family has grown
oranges for generations in Escondido.

1
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,710
HILLEBRECHT: All my life I've been right here.

1
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,220
If I live until December, I'll be 80 years old.

1
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,319
SHARMA: Hillebrecht would prefer
to sell his fruit to San Diegans.

1
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:57,289
HILLEBRECHT: But you can't make people
eat them just because they're grown here.

1
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,930
You buy them much cheaper from some place else.

1
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,380
Food in America is cheap.

1
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:08,080
You only spend 10 cents out of your
dollar or 11 cents as an average American.

1
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,759
SHARMA: But escalating water prices are making
it difficult for orange farmers like Hillibrecht

1
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,460
to keep on growing especially with
oranges coming from Australia or Brazil.

1
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:24,980
In fact, the Hillebrechts are turning
off the tap on some of their orange trees

1
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,390
because keeping them alive
is no longer profitable.

1
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,030
ERIC LARSON: Here in San Diego County,
it's tough for farmers to compete.

1
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:36,119
The land is expensive, labor is
expensive, and water is very expensive

1
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,669
because we import the water
from a great distance

1
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,509
so it makes a very, very difficult to compete.

1
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:43,940
SHARMA: The Hillebrecht family
has diversified what it grows

1
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,549
and its fallback crop is
San Diego top food crop.

1
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:52,909
Last year the county produced
59,000 tons of this fruit.

1
00:19:52,910 --> 00:20:04,100
Forty percent of the avocados
sold in the United States come

1
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:08,329
from San Diego County groves
like this one in Escondido.

1
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:12,490
When avocados aren't in season here,
chances are the ones you're buying

1
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,750
in the store came from Mexico or Chile.

1
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,309
MIKE HILLEBRECHT: In some ways that's beneficial

1
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:19,710
because the consumer can
buy avocadoes year around.

1
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:25,130
SHARMA: But Ben's son Mike Hillebrecht says
there are downsides to importing avocadoes

1
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,870
for San Diego growers, again
because of labor costs.

1
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,459
Local growers pay workers $8 an hour.

1
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,400
In Mexico, workers earn $4 dollars a day.

1
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,110
LARSON: Consumers really have a lot of control,
it's just they just don't tend to exercise it.

1
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:45,699
If the consumer truly wants to buy local fruits
and vegetables -- number one farmer's markets --

1
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,440
you can't sell at a farmer's market
unless you're a California grower

1
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,840
or a San Diego County grower so right there,
you know instantly, you're buying locally.

1
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,899
If a farmer ships out of the area, it
goes through an additional packing house,

1
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,780
they're only going to get
19 cents of the food dollar.

1
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:07,509
If it stays local and takes some of
those middlemen out of the equation,

1
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:11,839
they might be able to get a better
price for the product they sell.

1
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:17,519
FARYON: Tomatoes are the number
one favorite fruit among Americans.

1
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:24,119
As Reporter Ed Joyce tells us, San Diego County
grow the nation's largest vine-ripened crop.

1
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,909
ED JOYCE: San Diego County is home to the
largest community of organic tomato growers

1
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:33,440
in the state and nation, with 343
farms growing more than 150 crops.

1
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,410
We wanted to find out what the
difference was between organic

1
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,410
and conventionally grown tomatoes.

1
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,250
And whether the way they
were grown affected taste.

1
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,349
While tomatoes might be American's favorite,
they're also the fruit we're least satisfied

1
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:48,129
with when it comes to grocery store produce.

1
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,820
So we went to the People's
Organic Foods Market to talk

1
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:53,609
with the coop's marketing
director Amber McHale to find

1
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,879
out why the store only buys
and sells organic tomatoes.

1
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,210
As a disclaimer, I'm a member of the coop.

1
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,470
AMBER MCHALE: Some crops have been proven,
organically, to have a higher yield,

1
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,750
of certain vitamins, not all,
that's a study that's still ongoing.

1
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,519
But again, for me and for most of these
shoppers it's not the extra-added nutrition,

1
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:15,440
although again, when you have healthier soil,
you're going to have a healthier product.

1
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,180
It's the lack of what's not in there,Ã‚ those
synthetic toxic pesticides, those fertilizers.

1
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,120
JOYCE: Organic growers say residue

1
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,009
from pesticides can be harmful,
especially to children.

1
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:31,019
The EPA recently announced it will begin a
series of tests on pesticides and their affects

1
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:35,129
on human endocrine systems, which regulate
growth, metabolism and reproduction.

1
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,530
An environmental group in Washington D.C. ranked
43 fruits and vegetables based on the amount

1
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:44,269
of pesticides, but not the toxicity
of each pesticide, found on them.

1
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:49,490
Ã‚ Tomatoes ranked halfway down the list with 47
percent of the tomatoes containing pesticide.

1
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,609
Peaches were the worst offender,
with 97 percent.

1
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,019
JOYCE:Ã‚ Where do these tomatoes come from,

1
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,470
do they come from San Diego County,
do they come from California?

1
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,920
MCHALE: Right now all our tomatoes
are coming from California.

1
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,100
The jumbo's, the cherry and the heirloom
are coming locally from Be Wise ranch,

1
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:08,599
and the roma's are coming from the central
valley so it's regional, not local.

1
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,109
JOYCE: Casey Anderson is an organic grower.

1
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:15,649
He and his mother grow 13 varieties of
organic heirloom tomatoes in Valley Center.

1
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,830
It's late in the season so
Anderson's crop is winding down,

1
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:22,519
but buying locally-grown organic
tomatoes at a farmer's market is

1
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,650
as direct and fresh as they come.

1
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,000
But do they taste better?Ã‚ ANDERSON:
They all have different tastes.

1
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,289
I mean these, the green zebra's, these are um,
this is fully ripe, this is what they look like,

1
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,909
and they are really sweet, but they
taste like they got lime drizzled

1
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,910
over the top, they're really tangy.

1
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,160
JOYCE: When it comes to flavor,
it may just be matter of taste.

1
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,180
However, most tomatoes bought in a grocery
store have been picked when they're green

1
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,009
so they can survive long
trips across the country.

1
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,750
They're ripened artificially with ethylene gas.

1
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,200
Temperature also play a role.

1
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,759
Tomatoes won't ripen in temperatures
below 50 degrees.

1
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:04,190
Some varieties are also bred for shape, color
and shelf life -- not necessarily taste.

1
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,500
In California, most tomatoes
are destined for cans.

1
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,970
The state produces 90 percent of
the country's processed tomatoes.

1
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:18,120
FARYON: Americans eat more
per capita then ever before.

1
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,379
And according to government
statistics, one third of us are obese.

1
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,570
We buy 99-cent hamburgers and chicken
that costs less than a dollar a pound.

1
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:32,519
Producers in the food chain tell us we
want cheaper food and we want more of it.

1
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,859
DAVIS: Obviously the consumer votes
and tells you what's it's going to do.

1
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:41,969
If you're raising something the consumer
doesn't want and you don't sell it,

1
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,610
you're not going to raise it again.

1
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:45,699
So you will vote.

1
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,360
FARYON: And we've voted with our money.

1
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,939
We don't have enough time
to peel our own oranges

1
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,750
and we're too busy to find
out what's in our food.

1
00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:00,059
GRAHAM: If the soccer mom's got enough time
to do everything else she does and then worry

1
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:05,119
about the quality or the source of the fish
sticks she's feeding her kids then she could

1
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,289
look at these Web sites and
figure out how to do this.

1
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:13,730
FARYON: Can we actually track our food from
the dinner plate the farm field and ocean?

1
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,539
Most of it, we can't.

1
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:19,230
And what happens when that search leads us here?

1
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,309
The video you're about to see
is graphic and disturbing.

1
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:28,569
Last year, a California meat company
issued the largest meat recall in history.

1
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,539
143 million pounds of beef was recalled

1
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:37,440
after humane society video revealed
sick cows dragged to slaughter.

1
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,570
It's illegal to use sick animals in the
meat supply because of the risk of disease.

1
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:48,059
We had several questions for the USDA
when we began our investigation into food.

1
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,960
They didn't respond to most of our
emails or our request for an interview.

1
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,539
We did learn however, that so much of this
information is available to the public

1
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:02,599
on government and trade association
websites, and in the scientific literature.

1
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,629
Maybe we just stopped paying attention

1
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:10,910
because the new mass-produced food chain has
made life easy and the food we eat cheap.

1
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,860
Or maybe, we just don't want to
know where our food comes from.

1
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,480
You can find out more about
our food investigation

1
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,410
by going to our Web site: KPBS.org/food.

1
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,690
You can also leave a comment;
we'd love to hear from you.

1
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,390
For KPBS and Envision San
Diego, I'm Joanne Faryon.

1
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:40,160
Thanks for watching.

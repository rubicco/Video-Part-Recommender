killed in the past week. video assisted referees

and will theyjoin germany's next government?
social democrats add up the votes. president

1
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,179
trump has stepped up his war of words on trade
tariffs, suggesting he would "apply a tax"

1
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:05,890
on imports of cars from the european union.
it comes two days after he promised hefty

1
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,140
tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.

1
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,400
in a tweet, he said other countries had taken
advantage of the us for years. andrew plant

1
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,980
reports. the white hot glow of steel. this
multibillion-dollar global industry has sparked

1
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:28,060
heated threats of trade tariffs and friction
between the us and europe. it's disgraceful.

1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,780
and when it comes to a time when our country...
on thursday, donald trump announced plans

1
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,189
to levy a 25% tax on steel imports and 10%
on aluminium. the current deals, he said,

1
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:46,950
bad for the usa economy. european commission
president jean-claude juncker said the eu

1
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,699
could retaliate in kind with tariffs of its
own on things the us sells to europe. we buy

1
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,060
more steel from the united states than any
other country... canada, too, opposed the

1
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,730
idea, justin trudeau urging mr trump to reconsider.
..would be significant and serious.

1
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:09,950
now donald trump has hit back, threatening
to increase tax on imported european cars.

1
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:34,639
america, the eu's biggest car market. in a
tweet, he said: as yet, there's been no retaliatory

1
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,339
response, the press secretary simply saying
that no-one should be surprised at mr trump's

1
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:48,730
announcements. mr trump says other countries
have taken advantage of the us for years because

1
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:54,238
of what he called "very stupid" trade deals.
it's the latest salvo in a war of words over

1
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,659
trade tariffs - as our north america correspondent,
chris buckler, explains. yes, the threat of

1
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:03,909
new tariffs has fuelled fears of a trade war
but you are right in saying that the war of

1
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:06,270
words is well under way.

1
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,740
countries had already threatened retaliatory
action as a result of president trump's announcement

1
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,939
that he was preparing to put 25% tariffs on
steel and and 10% on aluminium being imported

1
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,680
into america. and probably one of the most
memorable warnings came from the european

1
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,040
commission presidentjean-claude juncker, who
said that they would tax the most american

1
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,870
of products, including bourbon and bluejeans.
while it is clear that president trump was

1
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,420
listening and today he bit back, it probably
will not come as a surprise to anyone that

1
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:41,239
he responded on twitter, saying that he was
prepared to tax cars coming into the us from

1
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:48,129
europe and it will cause concern across the
atlantic because the european car manufacturers’

1
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:52,579
biggest export market is the us. however,
there are many inside the white house who

1
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,910
are urging caution because they believe that
no-one really benefits from this kind of tit-for-tat

1
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:04,150
trade war. syrian government forces have gained
more ground in their assault on the last major

1
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,000
rebel-held enclave near damascus. one monitoring
group says they now control 10% of eastern

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,229
ghouta.

1
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:16,259
disturbing footage has emerged, showing aid
workers carrying an injured man into a van,

being targeted in an air-strike, but then
managing to escape. from neighbouring lebanon,

monitoring group the syrian observatory for

now recaptured two areas of the east and south-east

400,000 people are trapped. rebels, in turn,

at least 36 pro-syrian government troops sent
to support kurdish forces are reported to

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,699
have been killed by a turkish air strike.
six weeks ago, turkey launched a military

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:40,680
offensive in the area to clear it of kurdish
militia, which it sees as terrorists. our

let's take a look at some of the other stories

1
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,569
making the news. an extremist group affiliated
to al-qaeda in mali says it carried out the

1
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:58,069
two deadly bombings on friday in burkina faso’s
capital, ouagadougou. eight members of the

1
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:02,680
security forces were killed and more than
80 people were wounded in the attacks on the

1
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,430
army headquarters and french embassy.

1
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:12,990
the prime minister paul kaba thieba has visited
the scene and described it as "post-apocalyptic".

1
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,490
the funeral has taken place in slovakia of
the murdered investigative journalist, jan

1
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,019
kuciak. hundreds of mourners attended the
ceremony in the village of stiavnik, a day

1
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:27,079
after the burial of his fiancee, who was shot
dead at the same time. mr kuciak’s last

1
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:33,839
article focused on alleged ties between the
italian mafia and government officials. the

1
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,599
us secret service says a man has shot and
killed himself outside the white house in

1
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,669
washington. no-one else was injured in the
incident, which triggered a big security alert.

1
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:51,109
president trump was at his estate in florida
when the shooting happened. in one of the

1
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,199
biggest shake-ups in football for years, it
appears the world cup in russia will use video

1
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:02,750
technology, to assist referees. the system,
known as var, lets referees review controversial

1
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,310
incidents such as disputed goals or penalties.
the body which sets the rules for world football

1
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,310
has voted

1
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,530
to approve it after a series of top-level
trials, even though some of the decisions

1
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:20,568
have proved controversial. here's our sports
news reporter richard conway. from diego maradona's

1
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:26,870
hand of god to injustice in the biggest games.
football has long opposed technology to help

1
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,100
officials make the important decisions. but
after an historic vote all that has changed.

1
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:40,729
video assisted referees or var as it's known,
finally given the go-ahead. var is good for

1
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:50,339
football. it's good for refereeing. it brings
more fairness in the game. and, for these

1
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:59,329
reasons, we have decided to approve. var will
be used to correct errors relating to goals,

1
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:06,038
penalties, straight red cards and mistaken
identity. nearly 1000 games have formed part

1
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:11,009
of the two year var experiment. tottenham's
match against rochdale last week was included

1
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,110
in the trial

1
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,300
but was criticised given lengthy delays while
the referee reviewed incidents, leading to

1
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,660
claims technology is killing the atmosphere
and pace of the match. but one of the architects

1
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,639
of the new system told me there's evidence
that video assistance is working. on sort

1
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,389
of clear error situations, clear situations,
the accuracy of the referee's decisions went

1
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:37,820
from initially 93% up to around 99%. of course
there are grey areas where an incident could

1
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,289
be a penalty, could not be a penalty, and
they will always remain grey areas. var will

1
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:47,409
almost certainly now be used at this summer's
world cup. however, several premier league

1
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:51,778
clubs are said to be more cautious and may
opt to delay its implementation with football's

1
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:56,198
lawmakers admitting there's still work to
be done. i think the communication with the

1
00:08:56,198 --> 00:09:01,599
crowd, the speeding up of reviews, the flow
of the game, the spectator-spectacle, i think

1
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,619
has all got to be worked on, but we've also
got to have the confidence to sell it to people.

1
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:11,899
it is a change but it's actually a small change
to make a big difference. football's leaders

1
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:16,350
want to eliminate game-changing mistakes,
but as the experiments have shown, anyone

1
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,269
who thinks technology will stop controversy
may want to think again. richard conway, bbc

1
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:28,459
news. dr kristen wells is a sports psychologist
who's worked with women professional golfers

1
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:33,338
and in minor league baseball. i asked her
how she thinks var technology in football

1
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:40,929
will change the game. well, it depends on
the player and it depends on, in whose favour

1
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:46,448
the call goes toward. so the team that the
call is in favour of will certainly always

1
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:52,438
be happy. the team that the call goes against
will not be so happy. the issue is the momentum.

1
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:59,618
and, you know, if a team is in the zone and
suddenly, we are going to go to instant replay

1
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:07,439
- or var, as it is called - then you lose
that momentum. but, again, if the call goes

1
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:12,599
in favour of the team, the momentum lost isn't
going to be such a big deal.

1
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,058
for the other team, however, it could actually
then be an even further detriment to them.

1
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:23,759
but in terms of momentum, if you take, say,
rugby union- i don't know whether you know

1
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:31,579
how it works, being american - forgive me
- but with rugby union, they're used to having

1
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:35,409
a video assistant referee and it is just part
of the game, theyjust get on with it. right.

1
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:41,278
well, and here in the states, if you look
at american football, it is not such a big

1
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,220
deal because it has been around for so - it's
been around for decades. major league baseball

1
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,048
had just implemented it and so, you know,
they have been fortunate, they got to learn

1
00:10:51,048 --> 00:11:00,409
from american football. and so, it - the implementation
of it wasn't - hasn't been so bad, or at least

1
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:06,379
from the perspective of players and officials
and all,

1
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:11,810
it has not been a bad thing at all. it takes
time. fans will have to get used to it, players

1
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:15,729
will have to get used to it, and certainly,
officials will get used to it, but overall,

1
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,129
it is probably a good thing. what does this
do for the way that the game is perceived

1
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:26,239
because people say that basically, if you
get rid of human error, then there will be

1
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:31,089
nothing to talk about. but i'm not so sure
fans who are on the losing side agree with

1
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:38,510
that! i think there's always going to be human
error and, you know, it is... do you lose

1
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:47,879
a little bit of the human aspect to it? probably
so. is that a good thing? probably not. from

1
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:55,220
a psychological perspective, you know, i personally
would say i would hate to see you lose the

1
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:04,199
human piece of it. but if you look at the
benefits of using it, so say, for example,

1
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:10,299
officials - we know research was done and
what they found was that with video replay,

1
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:17,719
they went from 93% accuracy up to 98%, almost
99%, and how can you complain about that?

1
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,209
i mean, 93% is brilliant.

1
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,222
i mean - but the thing is, if you ask a football
fan that would probably say that referees

1
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:21,222
were always getting the calls wrong, not realising
that actually, they are doing a good job.

1
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:25,219
the funeral has taken place of the murdered
slovakian journalist, jan kuciak. his fiancee

1
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,139
martina kusnirova, who was also shot dead,
was buried on friday. he'd been investigating

1
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,899
alleged ties between the italian mafia and
slovak government officials. it's heightened

to resign over the issue. russell trott reports.

week,

1
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:06,588
along with his fiancee, martina kusnirova,
he was buried a day earlier. her parents were

1
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:12,049
also in attendance. there were two months
away from their wedding day. she'd been buried

1
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:21,730
in her wedding dress. the murders have shocked
this small central european country. there

1
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,249
have been protests in 25 cities, with many
venting their frustration at the prime minister

1
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:33,959
and his government, accusing it with links
to organised crime. he has denied any wrongdoing.

1
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:41,678
jan kuciak’s last article focused on alleged
ties between the italian mafia and officials.

1
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:45,889
seven people questioned by police have since
been released. the government has offered

1
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:54,918
a reward ofi million euros to find those responsible.
he has vowed his government would protect

1
00:13:54,918 --> 00:14:01,048

1
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:05,230
bang! the constitutional rights of these marchers
are their rights as citizens of the united

1
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,730
states, and they should be protected, even
in the right to test them out, so they don't

1
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,048
get their heads broken

1
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:15,730
and are sent to hospital. this religious controversy,
i know you don't want to say too much about

1
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,329
it, but does it worry you that it's going
to boil up when you get to the states? well,

1
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:33,698
it worries me, yes, but i hope everything
will be all right in the end, as they say.

1
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:39,389
this is bbc news. the latest headlines: president
trump has threatened to impose more tariffs

1
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:44,289
on imported goods. he's tweeted that if the
eu increases barriers for american companies,

1
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:50,719
then the us will apply a tax on eu cars. a
british-based monitoring group says pro-government

1
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,559
forces in syria have recaptured about 10%
of the rebel-held enclave of eastern ghouta

1
00:15:56,558 --> 00:16:03,429
outside damascus. votes are being counted
in germany after a poll of members of the

1
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:08,698
social democrats on whether the party should
join a grand coalition. officials say participation

1
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,488
has been very high.

1
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:15,420
chancellor angela merkel’s christian democrat
union has already voted in favour. if the

1
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:20,088
social democrats also approve, it will end
the five months of political deadlock which

1
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,579
have followed september's vote. the result
will be announced in a few hours time, as

1
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:31,258
the bbc’s tim allman reports. never in the
history of german politics has so much attention

1
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:37,938
been devoted to the contents of one rather
unremarkable lorry. on board, hundreds of

1
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:43,669
thousands of ballot papers that, one way or
another, will decide the immediate future

1
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:49,328
of the nation. keeping an eye on proceedings,
the social democrats' acting chairman olaf

1
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:56,188
scholz and the party's leader in the bundestag,
andrea nahles, both nervously awaiting the

1
00:16:56,188 --> 00:17:04,578
verdict of their membership. translation:
we already know there was a high level of

1
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:09,000
participation, so we hope we can lay a good
foundation for the renewal of the spd and,

1
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,259
at the same time, assess the implications
of

1
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:17,919
the result once we have it. angela merkel’s
party has already voted to renew the grand

1
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:25,240
coalition, hoping to end nearly five months
of deadlock. translation: it's up to us to

1
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,120
have the will to shape our country. it's up
to us to make these difficult times a success.

1
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:36,209
and it is up to us to find answers for our
party. i hope we can succeed together and

1
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:41,440
i'm optimistic, because i think we can do
it despite the difficulties. but what happens

1
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,600
if the social democrats say no? well, there
may be more talks to form a different type

1
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:52,480
of coalition or perhaps a minority government,
but the most likely scenario would be another

1
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,529
election with no guarantee of a more decisive
result. and for angela merkel and the country

1
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:07,038
she leads, there is a lot riding on this vote.
tim allman, bbc news. another country that

1
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,058
may soon have to confront weeks of coalition

1
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:14,119
talks is italy. the polls open there in just
under an hour's time as people vote for a

1
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,059
new government. immigration and high youth
unemployment have been the dominant issues

1
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:23,929
of the campaign. polls suggest the former
prime minister silvio berlusconi's centre-right

1
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:30,220
alliance could emerge as the largest bloc
in a hung parliament. julia ebner is a research

1
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,579
fellow at the london based institute for strategic
dialogue, who's been monitoring far-right

1
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:41,668
activity in the run-up to the election. we
have seen italian extreme right groups mobilising

1
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:45,909
across the country but also joining up and
collaborating with international far right

1
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:58,009
groups to influence the election outcome in
favour of far right parties, particular lega

1
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:05,159
nord. they have especially mobilised in the
online space, the online discourse, co-ordinating

1
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,890
their activity in private messaging groups
to then push it out into the mainstream. that

1
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,340
is something we have seen in

1
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,829
previous elections, especially folly the german
election campaigns that will let wi-fi the

1
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:20,720
german election campaigns that will let wi-fi
right extremist in germany and i have a tremendous

1
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,339
impact on setting the agenda for the online
discourse but then also influencing some of

1
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:31,099
the political topics that were actually pick
up both by the media but also then in the

1
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:33,349
debates between politicians to thatis the
debates between politicians to that is something

1
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:38,990
where we see them increasingly being able
to shape the discourse in the run-up to elections

1
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:45,339
and actually start getting into the top trends
on social media by tricking the example the

1
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:54,329
algorithms. some breaking news to bring you
now. south korea is sending a high-level delegation

1
00:19:54,329 --> 00:20:00,099
to visit north korea on monday for talks that
are widely expected to focus on resuming dialogue

1
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:05,429
between the communist state and the united
states. according to state media, the south

1
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,740
korean president moon jae-in has named his
top security adviser and the chief of the

1
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
country's spy

1
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,089
agency as his special envoys to pyongyang.
the delegation is then expected to travel

1
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:23,878
to the united states. in guatemala, various
local initiatives are under way to reduce

1
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:28,799
plastic pollution in the country. a study
has reported that guatemalans use one billion

1
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:38,119
plastic bags per month. virginia langeberg
has the story. francisco is doing what he

1
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:47,768
can to try to turn around guatemala's plastic
pollution problem. using mayan fabric to make

1
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:54,778
reusable cotton bags and weave a new way forward
for local communities. it's lengthy work,

1
00:20:54,778 --> 00:21:02,529
all done by hand. but for francisco, and for
the bigger picture, the payoff is worth it.

1
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:08,278
translation: when we work the land, we find
plastic bags covering the seeds, and the seeds

1
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:15,130
do not grow. it's a disaster. it is difficult
to quantify

1
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:21,360
the scale of the problem but one local university
study reported that guatemalans were using

1
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:31,538
i billion plastic bags monthly. translation:
we are being very moderate with our number,

1
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:36,210
but we know it's a problem that affects us
all. it's the equivalent of filling our local

1
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:44,610
lake five times over with the number of plastic
bags used each month. some guatemalan communities

1
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:51,528
have now ended the use of plastic bags. and
in the markets, the conscious changes can

1
00:21:51,528 --> 00:21:57,960
be seen, with locals using banana leaves to
wrap food, and others replacing plastic cups

1
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:10,100
with cardboard. each change helping to tailor
a new future with less pollution. a night

1
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:14,009
of rainbow flags, sequins and flamboyant displays
has

1
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:19,528
helped celebrate a milestone year for sydney's
gay and lesbian mardi gras. hundreds of thousands

1
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:24,538
of people turned out for the massive street
party, which this year marked a0 years since

1
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:30,028
activists first marched in the city for lgbt
rights. it's also australia's first parade

1
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:37,660
since legalising same sex marriage by public
survey in december. the as warmup to its famous

1
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,649
gay and lesbian mardi gras parade. the 40th
anniversary of the original march and the

1
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:44,898
first since australia said yes to same-sex
marriage. and the first since australia said

1
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:50,469
yes to same-sex marriagelj and the first since
australia said yes to same-sex marriage. i

1
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,700
feel like this is a really important platform
for me to show myself as a middle eastern

1
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:03,269
australian in address and show a different
side of us. people that don't have my phone

1
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,429
number. it means being loved and acce pt number.
it means being loved and accept that and,

1
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:13,809
you know, being acknowledged. 40 years, it
is a big thing, a milestone. writing up front,

1
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:16,408
the self-styled bikes on bikes kicked off
a night of colour, music, costumes and glitter.

1
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:27,610
there isa music, costumes and glitter. there
is a party going on right here. over 200 floats

1
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:33,168
paraded down sydney polls oxford street from
drag queens the giant bottles of champagne

1
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:43,269
and lgbt icon cher. but for many, the most
significant float is that of the 78ers, dedicated

1
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:46,726
to the original activist who marched 40 years
ago in syd ney activist who marched 40 years

1
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:49,809
ago in sydney and were met with police violence.
it is wonderful, exhilarating to have such

1
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:59,538
a wonderful audience to look at us and cheer
us and all that. we didn't have any of that

1
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:04,028
40 years ago. very proud pride march still
glowing

1
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:13,898
from the yes vote. here in the uk, pubs will
be allowed to stay open late to celebrate

1
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:22,888
the wedding of prince harry and the american
actress meghan markle. the big day is getting

1
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:30,028
closer and now pubs will be able to stay open
longer. cheers! on the friday night before

1
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:34,048
the royal wedding and a saturday night at
golf licensing hours of being extended till

1
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,349
one against the people have more time to raise
a glass to the happy couple. it isa raise

1
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:41,519
a glass to the happy couple. it is a great
idea, and let people celebrate and bring people

1
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:49,319
together. to connect people to the royal family
we need to be able to celebrate as well. very

1
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:56,168
much in favour! it is being all pubs need.
this has happened before, including for the

1
00:24:56,169 --> 00:25:01,280
wedding of the duke and duchess of cambridge
and the queen's 90th birthday. it is the home

1
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,750
secretary who can briefly loosened licensing
laws for special occasions. of course the

1
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,398
royal wedding coincides with this year's fa
cup final on the 19th of may but the government

1
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:16,638
says there have been no reports of increased
disorder when proper rules have previously

1
00:25:16,638 --> 00:25:21,759
been relaxed in this way. it is all about
community, it is about coming together and

1
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,058
celebrating, whether it is football are wedding
and i think actually it will be a great day

1
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,970
the people and pubs. on friday prince harry
and meghan markle announced over 1000 members

1
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,881
of the public will be invited to the grounds
of windsor castle to join be invited to the

1
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:35,881

to the grounds of windsor castle to join in

1
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:42,429
the celebrations and he wedding bells chime.
drinkers will hear a familiar peel through.

1
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:50,960
bell rings. just a little later than normal.
jessica parker, bbc news. if you would like

1
00:25:50,960 --> 00:26:05,519
any more on both stories, go to our website.
goodbye. hello, thanks forjoining me.

1
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,819
our latest look at how the weather will pan
out in the british isles for the next few

1
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:17,678
days or so. the good news is the forthcoming
week looks as though it will be nowhere near

1
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,879
as brutal as the weather we have just experienced.
having said that, it will tend to stay really

1
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:29,378
rather unsettled. nothing unusual for the
time of year. the area of low pressure driving

1
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:32,839
the weather at the moment is in fact going
to be with us for the rest of the weekend

1
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,898
and on into the start of the forthcoming week.
at least while that area of low pressure is

1
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:45,629
around we are looking towards the atlantic,
rather than towards the continent, scandinavia

1
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,710
and siberia, where all of that cold weather
came from that has affected so many so very

1
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:57,419
badly in recent days. and the first signs
of something a little milder is already there

1
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:03,080
to be had across parts of the far south. not
that much further north though. many more

1
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,369
of you are having to contend with scenes very
much more like that.

1
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:12,038
there will be a rather wintry flavour to the
start of the day across the northern half

1
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:17,200
of the british isles. temperatures in the
major towns and cities will be below zero.

1
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,558
as a consequence, there will be a widespread
problem of untreated surfaces with ice. that

1
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,759
does notjust extended in northern half of
the british isles, some spots further south

1
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:35,190
are covered by met office warnings. having
said that, much of what falls from the skies

1
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,399
during sunday will be watery rather than wintry.
there will be plenty of it as well, eventually

1
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:45,918
across east anglia and south-east. the north,
the high ground, further wintry showers across

1
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,528
northern and eastern parts of scotland. increasingly,
just beginning to move away from sea level.

1
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:56,558
no great problems with the fixture there.
manchester city taking on chelsea at the top

1
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,648
of the premier league. the forthcoming week,
as i have tried to reassure you already, you

1
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:05,418
need some, the snow will become increasingly
confined to the hills

1
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:11,649
northern britain. things will stay fairly
unsettled. this is a snapshot for monday.

1
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,658
we see further rain close to the centre of
the low pressure down towards the south-western

1
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:21,600
quarter. there is still some wintriness, particularly
on the higher ground of northern scotland,

1
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,109
elsewhere really not too bad at all as a start
to the week. many more of you will be getting

1
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:32,028
to work and notice the temperature is beginning
to creep up, nine, ten, 11 degrees or so.

1
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:35,192
here we are continuing a trend, certainly
across other parts, double figure temperatures.

1
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:35,210
they are on the way up across northern britain
as well.

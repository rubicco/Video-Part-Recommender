1
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:12,779
this is the briefing. i'm samantha simmonds.
our top story: a blueprint for brexit — theresa

1
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,448
may will deliver a long—awaited speech setting
out her plans for a future relationship with

1
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:23,868
the eu. the misery goes on — heavy snow
and deadly blizzards continue to lash many

1
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:31,759
parts of europe and will continue into the
weekend. i'm karin giannone, live in the italian

1
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,100
capital, rome, as the last days of campaigning
ahead of sunday's election get underway. there

1
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,090
are plenty of new faces and one very familiar
old one in the ring. and coming up in the

1
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,120
business briefing... raising the temperature.
president trump says he'll slap hefty tariffs

1
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:52,299
on foreign steel to protect us workers. but
is he playing with fire? we'll be getting

1
00:00:52,299 --> 00:01:14,149
the views of steel workers in pennsylvania
and the reaction on global markets. a warm

1
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:16,430
welcome to the programme — briefing you
on all

1
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:23,520
you need to know in global news, business
and sport. and you can be part of the conversation.

1
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,859
with transport chaos all over europe and people
stuck in their cars for hours, we're asking

1
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:34,138
if we've all been woefully underprepared for
the beast from the east, even though we knew

1
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:48,908
it was coming. tell us what you think — by
using the hashtag in a few hours, the british

1
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,319
prime minister, theresa may, will set out
her vision for britain's trading relationship

1
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,759
with the european union after brexit. she's
expected to say she wants the "deepest and

1
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,819
broadest possible" agreement, and acknowledge
that some compromises will be necessary. but

1
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:08,490
she's not expected to change her position
on removing the uk from the customs union.

1
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,000
bill hayton reports.

1
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,969
a shrug of hands and whimsical glance, the
body language of the european council president

1
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:24,120
after meeting theresa may on thursday wasn't
exactly enthusiastic. donald tusk told her

1
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,460
he wasn't happy with the british government's
red lines, the refusals to be part of the

1
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,200
eu's single market and customs union. in her
speech later on friday she will outline five

1
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:49,689
tests that any agreement must pass. it must
ensure that britain remains a tolerant, european

1
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:56,520
democracy and it must strengthen the unity
of the united kingdom. but some brexit supporters

1
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,260
say mrs may needs to go further. we need to
say, right, this is what we're after, we are

1
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,319
reasonable people, we are prepared to compromise,
but unless you're prepared to stop treating

1
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,699
us like a hostage, treat us with some respect,

1
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:16,889
then we will say that no deal is better than
a bad deal and walk away. however, one veteran

1
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,349
conservative politician, an opponent of brexit,
says that there is far too much to sort out

1
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:28,939
in such a short time. behind all the passion
about brexit, there are an awful lot of things,

1
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:34,319
important to our society, important to our
jobs, investment and also our security. and

1
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,859
the environment and other things have to be
sorted out. the eu's brexit negotiator wants

1
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,360
to hear specific proposals from the uk but,
with her own party still deeply divided, mrs

1
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,650
may's speech is more likely to stick to general
principles. we will have more analysis of

1
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,689
the speech coming up on the programme a little
later. heavy snowfall and deadly blizzards

1
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:04,568
will continue to lash many parts of europe
into the weekend, forcing airports to cancel

1
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:05,568
or delay

1
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:10,310
flights and rail services to stop trains around
the continent. the deep freeze has seen the

1
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,819
death toll climb to more than 50 and comes
as some countries now brace for a new round

1
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:39,870
of storms. virginia langeberg reports. the
snow 

1
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:48,769
storms have seen dozens perishing in freezing
conditions, many of them rough sleepers. in

1
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:56,409
south—east london man in his 60s died after
falling into frozen pond. it may now be officially

1
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,200
spring but the wintry blizzards continued
to bring highly unusual red weather alert

1
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,279
warnings in parts of the uk. it was hit overnight
by storm emma.

1
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,819
motorists were told to stay off the roads
but that message came too late for thousands

1
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:18,469
already stranded on motorways. here was one
of the lucky ones. somehow this car and bus

1
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,460
in edinburgh avoided being added to the road
accident statistics. portugal and spain have

1
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:30,469
been left battered by storm emma and are now
bracing for new storms, expected to bring

1
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,370
up to 75 millimetres of rain by the end of
the weekend. rough seas are already forcing

1
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:44,149
a offshore oil platform to run aground on
the canary islands. pass operation been left

1
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:49,329
frozen in time with temperatures plunging
2-23dc in time with temperatures plunging

1
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:59,139
2—23dc in eastern parts of the country.
—— parts of croatia have been left frozen.

1
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,769
what is a spectacle for some is an inconvenience
for many others. heavy

1
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:09,049
snowfall has left thousands stranded across
europe from flight and rail cancellations.

1
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:16,759
this is dublin airport, where flights have
been cancelled until saturday at the earliest.

1
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,480
we're going to have to stay here until saturday.
we're stuck here for two days. i love ireland.

1
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:35,509
but i'm trying to get out of here. when traditional
modes of transport fail, there will always

1
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:42,259
be those that improvise. in scotland people
in edinburgh had opted for skis to get around

1
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:48,519
on foot whilst in aldershot, home of the british
army, still soldiers incorporated a high octane

1
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:54,370
snowball fight as part of their physical training
session. and you will hardly hear complaints

1
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,579
for children with schools closed because of
the conditions meaning that london parks provided

1
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:02,829
the perfect wintry playground. perhaps the
only

1
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:05,759
ones enjoying the wintry cold more, these
baltic seals, in poland, a p pa re ntly these

1
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,699
baltic seals, in poland, apparently unfazed
by their frozen whiskers. and we might as

1
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:18,270
well settle in and try to cope, because the
cold is sticking around a while longer with

1
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:24,069
weather warnings remaining in place for the
uk until just after midnight on monday. let's

1
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:31,579
brief you on some of the other stories making
the news. the catalan separatist leader, carles

1
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:36,019
puigdemont, says he's ending his bid to be
re—elected president of the spanish region.

1
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:40,120
but he says the move is only temporary, to
try to break the stalemate with the spanish

1
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,800
authorities. he's been living in self—imposed
exile in belgium since last year's independence

1
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,540
referendum. he faces arrest if he returns.
police in northern france are reopening files

1
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,040
on unsolved rape cases — after a man admitted
carrying out around a0 sex attacks dating

1
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,520
back to the 1990s. french media have named
the suspect as dino scala — a 57 year—old

1
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:10,620
grandfather and caretaker who was president
of his village football club.

1
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:18,769
now to our top business story. on his way
to the presidency, the plight of america's

1
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:24,079
steelworkers was a core theme in donald trump's
message of america first. now he's delivered

1
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,310
on that promise to protect an industry in
decline — announcing steep new tariffs on

1
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,990
steel and aluminium imports next week. the
international response was immediate. canada

1
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,259
described the tariffs as completely unacceptable.
both the european union and china threatened

1
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:40,259
to retaliate — fuelling fears of a global
trade war. joel kibazo is a partner at jk

1
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:45,049
associates and a former director of communications
at africa development bank. welcome, good

1
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:48,189
morning. this announcement seems to have caught
everybody by surprise. announcement seems

1
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,420
to have caught everybody by surpriselj announcement
seems to have caught everybody by surprise.

1
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:56,379
i think it did. in some ways we should have
expected something like this because president

1
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:01,500
trump did sort of make these points during
his campaign to become president. but when

1
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,000
you wander was a feeling that some of

1
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,399
that was campaign rhetoric and so would not
cause the much of a trade war plus his party,

1
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,699
the republicans, are the party of free—trade
zone there was an expectation that it would

1
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:21,670
go ahead in a very mild form. the way it has
happened a stake by surprise. usually there

1
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:29,199
are leaks and signals before something like
this happens which helps market sort of study.

1
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,911
because it has just come out of the blue,
and we have seen the department of trade,

1
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:39,069
and the business community in the us was not
prayer “— business community in the us

1
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,100
was not prayer —— was not prepared for
this, so prayer —— was not prepared for

1
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,659
this, so hence the falls we have seen on wall
street and in asian markets. he's talking

1
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:52,909
about 25% tariff on steel imports and 10%
on aluminium. there has been an angry reaction

1
00:09:52,909 --> 00:10:02,699
from around the world. much of this is aimed
at china. president trump believes that the

1
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
trade with china

1
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,660
is unfair, but that's only 2% and actually
the societies that will be at our places like

1
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:14,350
south korea, one of the main exporters to
the united states, the third biggest after

1
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,028
canada and brazil the united states. above
all that there is also the fa ct above all

1
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:22,409
that there is also the fact that it will make
things more expensive for consumers. that

1
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:28,500
is why wall street this falling and markets
are reacting. and joel will be back in about

1
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,330
half an hour to review the main stories being
covered by the global media. stay with us

1
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,440
for that. italians will head to the polls
this sunday to elect a new president. the

1
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,790
race is between three main parties. there's
the centre—right forza italia, headed by

1
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:50,110
a familiar face — former prime minister
silvio berlusconi. then there's the five star

1
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,850
movement, started star movement, started by
comedian bepe grillo in 2009 and now one of

1
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,310
europe's biggest populist movements. finally
the ruling democratic party led by former

1
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:05,369
prime minister matteo renzi. well let's cross
live to rome. my colleague karin giannone

1
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,370
is there for us.

1
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:13,870
good morning to you, karen. good morning,
samantha. italy has been in the grip of final

1
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,679
—— severe winter weather for the final
days of this election campaign. there has

1
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:26,629
been a lot of noise from the extremes of politics
and as you mentioned there, re—entering

1
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:32,278
the political stage and reinventing himself
as an elder statesman is a very familiar figure

1
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:37,490
of 81—year—old silvio berlusconi, but
he is barred from actually holding office

1
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:43,089
so he is maintaining the campaign from the
sidelines, if you like, but very much centre

1
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:48,050
stage as well. he can't actually be prime
minister because of a tax fraud conviction

1
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:56,500
in 2013. let's discuss this more, with me
is the chair of constitutional law at a university

1
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:04,419
here in rome. 0n the issue of silvio berlusconi,
what exactly can you do? he was convicted

1
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,039
and since there is

1
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:13,620
a law that provides as a consequence that
he is banned from public office, he has filed

1
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:22,089
an appeal to the european court of human rights,
but the final decision is not due before fall,

1
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:29,780
so at this moment that rules him out of the
possibility to hold any office but as you

1
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,959
know, he'sa very hold any office but as you
know, he's a very charismatic leader, so,

1
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,430
asa he's a very charismatic leader, so, as
a political leader from his party, as the

1
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:48,579
opinion polls show, he is very able to mobilise
the actors and his party is gaining, and there

1
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:55,339
isa and his party is gaining, and there is
a slight possibility that the right—wing

1
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:01,089
coalition wins an outright majority on the
day of the election. there is an interesting

1
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,589
factor this time around that the

1
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:08,850
electoral system is actually a new one. it
is a very complicated. no one. it is a very

1
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,839
complicated. no one is sure how it is going
to work. it is complicated because it is a

1
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:21,230
mixture of systems. two thirds of it is proportional
in mechanism and the third part is first past

1
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:28,300
the post. since the italian system, as everybody
knows, is a very fragmented system, it is

1
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:38,949
very unlikely that some party or some coalition
gets a majority so, if silvio berlusconi is

1
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:47,220
such a success, it is possible, but not very
likely. then what happens, it is going to

1
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:53,810
be interesting to see. but what i would rule
out is that the president goes for another

1
00:13:53,809 --> 00:14:01,399
dissolution. there is no tradition of double
dissolution, one following the other. the

1
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,370
possibility is that we restored the negotiation

1
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,328
as it has happened in many countries in europe.
we have to leave it there. we could be seeing

1
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:18,289
a period of more uncertainty for many weeks
to come. giovanni, thank you. with that, it

1
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:25,110
is back to you in london. stay with us on
the briefing. also on the programme... pick

1
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,209
up a penguin — we'll tell you about the
thriving colony of birds enjoying life off

1
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:44,419
the antarctic peninsula. first the place slid
gently off the restaurant tables, then suddenly

1
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:50,329
the people, the tables on the chairs crashed
sideways and downwards and it was just a matter

1
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:58,009
of seconds until the very lurched onto our
side. a hydrogen bomb on a remote pacific

1
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:03,259
atoll. the americans have successfully tested
a weapon which dwarfs the force of the bomb

1
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:04,269
dropped on hiroshima.

1
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:15,230
i had heard the news earlier and my heart
went bang and bang. the constitutional rights

1
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,709
of these marshals are the rights of the citizens
of the us, and they should be protected so

1
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:27,088
they do not get their heads broken and sent
to hospital. this religious controversy, i

1
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:31,470
know you don't want to say much about it,
but will it boil up when you get to the state?

1
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:47,670
it worries me, but i think i'm going to be
all right you're watching the briefing. 0ur

1
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:51,549
headlines: heavy snowfall and deadly blizzards
will continue to lash many parts of europe

1
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:56,919
into the weekend, forcing airports to cancel
or delay flights and rail services to stop

1
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:01,969
trains around the continent. our top story
— in a few hours, britain's prime minister

1
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,160
will set out her vision for britain's trading
relationship with the european union after

1
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,389
brexit. let's stay with that now.

1
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:14,959
with me is dr elaine fahey, reader in european
law at city university here in london. good

1
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,958
morning. thank you for coming in. this is
being billed as a real step forward and from

1
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,169
what we have seen step forward and from what
we have seen about what the prime minister

1
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:27,509
was going to say, do you think it is? is difficult
to have a step forward after the obligation

1
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:35,149
of the eu draft treaty on wednesday. my understanding
is that this is sound bites and the eu needs

1
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:41,828
to see the detail of what the uk in visages
going forward. one year before we have to

1
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:46,479
leave, and we are still talking about what
we want never mind actually deciding what

1
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,399
we want. theresa may is struggling to unite
her own party and satisfy the demands of the

1
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,740
eu at the same time. it is almost impossible
balancing act that she is juggling but the

1
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,930
uk signed up in december two seconds set up
as a pulse of the treaty published on wednesday

1
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:02,929
is not

1
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:08,448
necessarily so different. it is difficult
to see how this division in the face of uk

1
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,610
agreement, as of december. what do you think
we will hear about northern ireland, which

1
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,740
isa hear about northern ireland, which is
a sticking point, as we heard in the withdrawal

1
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:27,630
agreement published on wednesday? the eu envisages
something that the british prime minister

1
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,390
says will not allow to happen. how are they
going to come together on this? the treaty

1
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:42,390
is saying, this is an entity for the purposes
of law, and the uk is signed up to the integrity

1
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,900
of the single market and to have alignment
and a frictionless border, and there was concern

1
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:55,650
in the eu that there are still not a viable
technology from the uk about the technology,

1
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:02,470
and it is difficult to see how this is going
to move forward without some

1
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,440
very specific proposals in this speech today.
they think the eu is becoming increasingly

1
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,370
intra nsigent orders arejust seen becoming
increasingly intra nsigent orders are just

1
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:17,049
seen that way from their tough language and
you think they would be prepared to see deal?

1
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:22,889
the fact the remains that there is no precedent
for what the uk wants, and the eu has a variety

1
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,200
of partnerships out there, although these
are not something that the uk was to sign

1
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,130
up to so that puts the eu ina was to sign
up to so that puts the eu in a difficult position

1
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,520
as they are to satisfy the uk's needs in the
absence of detail. good to get your thoughts.

1
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,558
we'll focus on a speech in a couple of hours'
time. here's our briefing on some of the key

1
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:48,119
events happening later. we begin in new york
for the opening of the "david bowie is" exhibition.

1
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,729
then later president donald trump's former
campaign manager paul manafort will appear

1
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,829
in a us court to be arraigned on a second
indictment filed against him.the new 32—count

1
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:04,230
indictment alleges he committed bank fraud
and filed false tax returns. and later on

1
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,759
in paris, the french equivalent of the oscars
kicks off. at this year's cesars the aids

1
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,759
drama

1
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:17,279
120 bpm and world war i drama au revoir la—haut
are among the favourites. now it's time to

1
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:23,940
get all the latest from the bbc sports centre.
hello there, coming up in your friday sport

1
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,799
briefing, american deontay wilder has his
eyes on andyjoshua, despite his wbc heavyweight

1
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,889
title defence in new york this weekend against
luis 0rtiz. the world indoor athletics continues

1
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,230
and cliff diving in the azores sounds nice.
but you may want to think again when you see

1
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:50,849
what it involves. deontay wilder will defend
his wbc heavyweight title against cuban, luiz

1
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:55,569
0rtiz on saturday when they meet in new york.
the american holds one of the four heavyweight

1
00:19:55,569 --> 00:20:00,069
titles and is already talking about a potential
unification fight against briton, andyjoshua.

1
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:08,089
but speaking to the bbc, obstacles are being
put up byjoshua's promoter, eddie hearn.

1
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:14,449
i don't believe they want it. and when i say
they, i mean eddie. eddie hearn, i don't believe

1
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,400
eddie hearn wants this fight at all. why not?
because, like i say, joshua is like annabel

1
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:29,250
the cow, eddie hearn is milking him. milking
him, every dollar. every dollar. the world

1
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,819
indoor aathletics championships are underway
in birmingham and there is plenty to feast

1
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,689
your eyes on later. the south african is the
strong favourite in the long jump final on

1
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,230
friday night. the showpiece event is the women's
60 metres final where all eyes will be on

1
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,740
elaine thomson. the double olympic champion
is hoping to get her season back on track

1
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:54,599
after some poor form. the jamaican hasn't
come close to the time she posted last year.

1
00:20:54,599 --> 00:21:01,819
in case you missed it, a sparsely filled emirates
stadium in north london. arsenal were given

1
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:06,308
a first— half footballing lesson by manchester
city in the premier league just days after

1
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,339
being beaten by the same team in the league
cup final.

1
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:14,209
three first half goals led by german international,
leroy sane, who scored one himself, wasn't

1
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:21,160
at the interval vote. arsenal failed to score
and saw aubameyang have a penalty saved, heaping

1
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,890
more pressure on gunners' boss, arsene wenger.
physically, certainly, our highest game of

1
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,480
the season. them as well, we played with low
confidence and we could see that at the start

1
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,990
of the game and we paid for it. they were
a quality team and they took advantage of

1
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:46,370
that. after that, we maintained and we needed
the penalty to go in to have a little chance

1
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:53,579
to come back. that was another negative in
the second half. in the end, we lost against

1
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:59,649
a team which is the best in the country at
the moment. the spanish leaders, barcelona

1
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,910
extended their club record unbeaten league
run to 33 games, but they could only manage

1
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:09,880
a 1—1 draw to las palmas. lionel messi gave
barcelona the lead just after the 20 minute

1
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
mark,

1
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,809
but a second—half penalty rescued it for
the canary islands hosts. the catalans moved

1
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:27,690
five points clear of atletico madrid, when
it comes to cliff diving, you need lots of

1
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,820
skill and dedication, but above all, you need
guts. just take a look at this. this cliff

1
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:39,200
diver posted this of himself in the azores
in the atlantic. the american says i am scared

1
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,960
of the potential consequences of a cliff dive
gone wrong. almost as much as having to hold

1
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:55,529
and nine to five office job. i know how he
feels. you can get all those stories on our

1
00:22:55,529 --> 00:23:03,279
website. from me, that is your friday sport
briefing. an international team including

1
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,548
scientists from oxford university has discovered
a thriving colony

1
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:12,980
of more than 750,000 penguins off the antarctic
peninsula. with little human activity on the

1
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,089
danger islands, a so—called super—colony
of adelie penguins is thriving. whilst the

1
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:22,220
same species is in decline on the other side
of the peninsula. 0ur science correspondent

mounted an expedition to the wrote, rocky

may be in the depths of a freezing and rather

1
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:06,059
dark winter but its capital copenhagen is
awash with light.

1
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:11,418
it's for the city's first international light
festival. a total of a0 illuminated artworks

1
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:17,799
dot the quay, small parks and buildings, with
danish elements of minimalism, sustainability

1
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:23,230
and scandinavian design featuring heavily.
0rganisers say the festival is aimed at getting

1
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:32,069
the danes out of the house in winter, to see
copenhagen in a new light. that's pretty spectacular.

1
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:36,638
stay with me on bbc news, i'll be back with
the business briefing in just a few moments

1
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:40,750
— we'll have more on president trump's move
to slap tariffs on imported steel — plus

1
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,720
the economic challenges facing italy. tell
me what you think about our talking point

1
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,279
today — with transport chaose all over europe
and people stuck in their cars for hours — we're

1
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,940
asking if we've all been woefully underprepared
for the beast from the east — even though

1
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,870
we knew it was coming. i have been very disappointed
with

1
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:04,979
the gritting, or the lack of it, in my area.
stay with us here on bbc news so much more

1
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:15,500
to come. we've seen treacherous conditions
in the uk and there are more warnings from

1
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,170
the met office, with amber weather warning
still in force across scotland, northern ireland

1
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:26,640
and the north east of england with frequent
showers, those warnings expiring at 10am.

1
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,659
by the early hours of the morning we will
have lost that red warning towards the south—west

1
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,430
and wales, but there are still that amber
weather warning until eight o'clock or so.

1
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:39,360
that's no we have been seeing has been particularly
bad in hampshire, and that has been due to

1
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:46,359
a combination of storm emma and the cold air
brought about by the beast from the east.

1
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:52,949
dennis taylor: as low as they have been, but
there are still the strong wind around and

1
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,073
a good deal of cloud. those snow showers continue
across the north and east of scotla nd across

1
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,200
the north and east of scotland running through
the central belt and the north east of england.

1
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,279
and we could see more snow developing not
just and we could see more snow developing

1
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,279
notjust across northern

1
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,109
ireland and wales but in southern england,
especially during the afternoon, and patch

1
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:11,319
is slowly work its way north, with some uncertainty
about how much snow we will get during the

1
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:16,548
day on friday. another called david temperatures
struggling to get above freezing, and we still

1
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:20,869
have that easterly winds that is what it's
going to feel like if you're out in the wind.

1
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:27,839
another very cold day ahead. things are going
to change. the beast from the east, that strong

1
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,459
easterly wind being replaced by something
a little less cold, coming up from the south,

1
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,039
with the weather beginning to come from southern
climes rather than all the way from siberia,

1
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:43,879
so we should see temperatures lifting, slowly.
we still have the threat of more snow showers

1
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,440
across northern parts of the uk will restore
still have a cold, easterly wind. further

1
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,470
south, the winds will becoming lighter and
it should be driver soweto weather beginning

1
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,720
to arrive in the south later but by the most
part, this should be rain. over the hills,

1
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,650
we could see some snow pushing northwards
overnight towards the borders and across northern

1
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,650
england,

1
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,019
with some wetter weather returning to southern
areas. a messy purge on sunday, losing that

1
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:14,691
cold, easterly wind, the winds should be lighter
and temperatures will be rising to around

1
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:21,659
eight or nine in the south, across the northern
isles, temperatures will not be as low. gradually

1
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,650
becoming less cold across southern parts,
but they're still a risk of some rain, but

1
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:39,480
also, some snow.

un security council has postponed a vote on

1
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,250
a ceasefire in syria until later on saturday.

1
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,010
the resolution would have allowed vital aid
supplies to reach eastern ghouta. opposition

1
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:24,400
activists say hundreds have now died in aerial
attacks. this is what happened in eastern

1
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:39,460
ghouta as diplomacy stuttered - the enclave
was pounded. above them, russian jets with

1
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:45,519
their syrian allies were in action as the
russians demanded guarantees that rebel fighters

1
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:52,719
would respect any truce. in eastern ghouta,
men from civil defence risked their lives

1
00:01:52,719 --> 00:02:03,659
to rescue civilians, even though the buildings
could collapse and the planes could come back.

1
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,478
in the dust and confusion, these children
were separated from their parents. the rescuers

1
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,310
ignored the dangers.

1
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:21,670
the eu condemned what it called "brutal attacks".
diplomacy is supposed to find words and deeds

1
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:29,199
to stop this happening. they were rushed into
underground hospitals. it is hard to end a

1
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:35,919
war, or even a battle, with words, especially
when one side - in syria, the regime and its

1
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:43,449
allies - believes victory is close. in syria,
military power, the capacity to inflict pain

1
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:54,769
and death, sets the pace of events. treating
the wounded is twig another is to recreate

1
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:02,689
small pockets of normality, kindness and decency.
this girl is 11 years old and, like most people

1
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:06,000
in eastern ghouta, she has been living in
a basement.

1
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,349
mothers and their children wait and hope.

i went to school and saw my friends. we are
here in the shelter because of the bombing.

1
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:26,318
the rockets and missiles never end. i hope
the war will stop so we can go home. among

1
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:53,540
ran out of time. in syria, no-one can rest
in peace. jeremy bowen, bbc news. one of donald

1
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:58,060
trump's former senior advisers, rick gates,
has admitted conspiring against the united

1
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:05,989
states and lying to investigators. for his
cooperation on the investigation into russian

1
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,129
interference in the us election. a short time
ago, peter bowes talked us through the significance

1
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:16,600
of the charges. well, i suppose the charges
in themselves are not as significant as the

1
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:26,199
fact that he has now reached a plea agreement
which means 

1
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,598
in all and any matters associated with the
russia investigation and that is what is so

1
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:39,569
crucial about it, because he was at the heart
of the donald trump election campaign in 2016

1
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,199
with his long-time colleague paul manafort.
they were both there, they were both at the

1
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:55,520
republican convention that year, they were
both involved so the question is what does

1
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,418
he know, what information does he have that
could perhaps incriminate former colleagues

1
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:08,758
and shed some light on whether there was any
collusion between the trump campaign and the

1
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,150
russians. this isn'tjust about potential

1
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:17,079
meddling between russia and - or at least
meddling that would affect the election campaign,

1
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:26,579
those claims have been made as well, indeed
13 russians last year this goes much deeper.

1
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,508
but crucially, peter, so far, no-one has been
directly indicted - this is within the trump

1
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:37,569
campaign - directly indicted for collusion
with russia. we should just stress that, shouldn't

1
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:45,088
we? yes, that is, and certainly mr manafort
strongly denies the allegations against him.

1
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:51,468
and you are right, no-one has been indicted
in terms of any potential alleged collusion

1
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:56,589
- at least no-one associated with the trump
campaign. but this is an investigation which

1
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,810
is ongoing.

1
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,399
the special counsel is certainly digging very
deep and i think the indictments we have seen

1
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,899
over the last few days, and the one against
mr manafort, which continues, show that he

1
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:13,778
is leaving no stone unturned in terms of the
depths that he will go to get to the heart

1
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:19,319
of the matter. and it can only be a matter
of concern to some, perhaps, that, certainly,

1
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,499
mr gates is now ,, , will reveal everything
that he knows. and he will reveal everything

1
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:31,050
that he knows. president trump has repeated
his call for teachers to be armed with guns.

1
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:39,250
pressure is growing for action after the shooting
at a school meanwhile, florida's governor

1
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,959
wants to restrict the sale of guns. our north
america editor jon sopel reports. staff and

1
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,058
teachers return to the marjory stoneman douglas
school today as a nation continues to grope

1
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:58,150
for explanations of what happened. for others,
it's mental health and societal breakdown.

1
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:04,310
but today, a new culprit - scot peterson,
a deputy sheriff who arrived outside the school

1
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:10,088
90 seconds after the shooting started, but
for whatever reason didn't act. and he's taking

1
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:14,240
a mighty kicking from the president. he was
there for five minutes, for five minutes.

1
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,370
that was during the entire shooting - he heard
it right at the beginning - so he certainly

1
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:26,639
did a poorjob. but that's a case where somebody
was outside, they were trained, but they didn't

1
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,199
react properly under pressure, or they were
a coward. speaking to conservative activists,

1
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,800
the president also restated his belief that
some teachers should be carrying concealed

1
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,160
weapons in school. and the beauty is it's
concealed - nobody would ever see it unless

1
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,819
they needed it. it's concealed! so this crazy
man who walked in wouldn't even know who it

1
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:55,490
is that has it! that's good! that's not bad,
that's good! and a teacher would have shot

1
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,860
the hell out of him before he knew what happened.
cheering and applause. and in florida, the

1
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
governor has

1
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,879
announced a range of measures to tighten security.
the goal of this plan of action is to make

1
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,088
massive changes in protecting our schools,
provide significantly more resources for mental

1
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:19,259
health, and to do everything we can to keep
guns out of the hands of those dealing with

1
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:33,039
mental problems or threatening but so far,
there have only been sketchy proposals and

1
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,978
no class of weapon is being banned. well on
the way? well, that might be wishful thinking.

1
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:46,980
jon sopel, bbc news, washington. well, earlier,
ispoke tojim irvine of the buckeye firearms

1
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:55,220
association and taught to deal with attacks.
i pointed out that many people are against

1
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:02,190
arming teachers. well, we don't want our kids
to keep getting killed.

1
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,430
but looking at all the evidence, say, for
example, the fbi has compiled so far, they

1
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:11,388
haven't seen any evidence that arming people
in these sorts of situations prevents them

1
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,289
from happening, or stops the perpetrators
from carrying on with what they want to do.

1
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:23,179
i beg to differ. imagine if that coach had
a firearm. he was there, he went to the event.

1
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:28,349
we've got these people in every school. all
we're talking about is the select people.

1
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,220
there is no disagreement that the vast majority
of our school staff do not want to carry a

1
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,970
firearm. that's fine. there's nothing wrong
with them and no-one should ever be forced

1
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,480
but if we have people who are going to the
scene on a - to die on the event, how about

1
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,289
we get them training so that they live through
this event? how about they end the killing

1
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,110
before one more kid gets shot? i don't understand
how that is controversial, giving them the

1
00:09:50,110 --> 00:10:00,220
tools to do that. but what are the practicalities
of this? unless you put an armedteacbet

1
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,540
classroom or at every single entrance, you
willjust have teachers walking around with

1
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:10,409
guns. we have that in hundreds of schools
and it works just fine. there is no problem

1
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,569
and they have not been killing at those schools.
so you're saying that the reason this school

1
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,589
in florida was attacked was because - are
you saying that it was not well defended?

1
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:23,100
no, i don't know why it was attacked. but
what we do know, when we study active killer

1
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,440
events, almost every one in this country happens
in the few places where the victims are not

1
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,731
allowed to shoot back. there is an absolute
trend there. gun control is a failure. when

1
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:41,720
you look at the results, that it ends up in
more dead people, of a well-meaning policy.

1
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,500
but the bottom line is results matter, and
the results of gun control are failure and

1
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,190
dead kids. it's enough. let's take a look
at some of the other stories making the news.

1
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,190
the united states is to extend its stop-and-search
operations on ships suspected of violating

1
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:03,690
sanctions against north korea. it's the latest
us effort to stop pyongyang's nuclear programme.

1
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:09,110
18 people have died in two bomb blasts in
the somali capital mogadishu. a suicide bomber

1
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,310
blew up a car near the presidential palace
and a second blast was close to the national

1
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:22,388
intelligence agency. both were followed by
heavy gunfire. the president of the european

1
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:27,680
council has described as "pure illusion" any
attempt by britain to pick and choose the

1
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,458
terms of its future relationship with europe.
speaking at a summit of eu leaders which was

1
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:37,549
not attended by britain, donald tusk said
he hoped to get more clarity on exactly what

1
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:43,099
britain's proposals were when he meets theresa
may next week. from brussels, damian grammaticas

1
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:50,860
reports. france, germany, italy - europe's
leaders all in brussels today, all waiting

1
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,690
to hear what the uk wants from its future
ties. but if theresa may's plan is to seek

1
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,740
special access to the single market for parts
of the uk economy, it was immediately rebuffed.

1
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:09,480
it's not an a la carte. it's not possible
to be aligned with the european union when

1
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,100
it suits and not what it doesn't. that's not
possible. the eu doesn't yet know what was

1
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,170
decided by mrs may and her ministers at chequers
yesterday but eu leaders have said before,

1
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:25,399
and they said again today, she can't pick
and choose only the bits of the single market

1
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:32,689
she likes. i'm glad that the uk government
seems to be moving towards a more detailed

1
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:40,850
position. however, if the media reports are
correct, i am afraid that the uk position

1
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:50,620
today is based on pure illusion. it looks
like the cake philosophy is still alive. but

1
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,240
the uk's exit poses problems for the eu, too.
today, its leaders were tackling perhaps the

1
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,600
thorniest issue of all -

1
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,259
the eu's looming budget problem. when uk payments
to the eu cease, the eu will face a shortfall

1
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:10,909
of more than ten billion euros a year - that's
at least 10% of its annual spending. there

1
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:20,909
is a hole in the budget, so is your country
prepared well, you know, if you listen to

1
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:26,539
politicians, there's a hole in the budget,
but finally, things are financed. so if we

1
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:32,828
want to finance more, we have to pay more.
it's very simple. is your country prepared

1
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:38,269
to pay more after brexit? no. if i should
keep my answer short, i would say no. so hints

1
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:43,480
at divisions between eu countries, and that
mightjust give the uk some leverage in the

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:51,480
negotiations to come. damian grammaticas,

the prince proposed to lady diana spencer

hesitation. as revolutions go, this had its

there is joy and relief today, the scars are

ceasefire. earlier i spoke with lina sergie

1
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:52,730
attar, a syria-american

1
00:15:52,730 --> 00:16:01,250
writerfrom aleppo, and ceo and co-founder
of karam foundation - aid to syrians. she

1
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:07,610
gave us her view on the political and humanitarian
situation well, first of all, thank you for

1
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,379
having me on this very tragic week for syria,
when we have seen the war escalate even further,

1
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:21,818
the syrian ground war. it has become the norm
for these kinds of situations where the regime

1
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:29,889
and russia are bombarding areas like eastern
ghouta, like we saw last year in aleppo. and

1
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:36,659
when it comes down to the security council
bringing in a resolution that will stop the

1
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:45,469
violence across the country for 30 days to
give civilians the relief they need. russia

1
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,028
delays the vote

1
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:52,879
and will probably veto it. i thought that
was the whole point of diplomats here, supposed

1
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,090
to be able to bridge the gaps where they exist?
well, when it comes to syria, what we have

1
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:05,088
seen over the past seven years, so many resolutions
that were aimed towards protection of civilians

1
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:16,809
against used starvation as a weapon of war,
and all of the war crimes that are being used

1
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:22,679
against the syrian people over almost seven
years, with hundreds of thousands of people

1
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,950
dead, millions of refugees, millions of displaced,
over 5 million people in need of humanitarian

1
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:34,049
assistance inside the country and still, these
resolutions get vetoed by russia. so, it would

1
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:42,240
seem that this, if it can be gotten through,
would be just a sticking plaster? true, but

1
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,829
it would be also saving lives, as many lives
as we can save, at least opening up humanitarian

1
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:54,639
corridors to reach the people of eastern ghouta,

1
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:08,259
of attacks and violence by the regime humanitarian
agencies need to reach the people of eastern

1
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:14,869
ghouta. over 400,000 people are living in
this siege and people must be able to reach

1
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:21,319
them and to help them, and to be able tee
helprasmany able to survive. how can people

1
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:27,509

assisted at this point in time? 515155â€œ

to be able to enter eastern ghouta,

1
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:57,359
and reach the children and the elderly who
are suffering from extreme malnutrition. when

1
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,389
america announced last september that its
embassy in havana would no longer be issuing

1
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,820
visas, it marked a serious cooling of relations
with cuba. it also meant cubans would have

1
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:14,681
to travel to the embassy in colombia making
it much harderfor people to visit family in

00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:23,009
the us. andrew plant reports. a hotel room
in colombia. this man is already a long way

1
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:29,619
from home. he has come from cuba, bags packed
with paperwork to try to get a visa to enter

1
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:40,549
the usa and visit the family he hasn't seen
for almost six years. translation: i'm really

00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:44,940
looking forward to this life-changing moment.
all the effort will be worth it. to be with

1
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:59,190
my family - that's my one 
and only wish. but now they must travel 2,000

1
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:06,250
kilometres to bogota in colombia. last year,
president trump announced the us was suspending

1
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:13,299
visa processing in havana, partially reversing
processes put in place by barack obama. the

1
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:18,869
number of immigrant visas issued to cubans
has since crashed. the extra travel costs

1
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:32,219
simply too much for many. pedro; a pastrrsatesmant-
getting the paperwork he needs. translation:

1
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,539
today i have got what i most desired, to reunite
with my family and share time with them in

1
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:43,720
the united states, to see my children and
grandchildren, all my family. now united after

1
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,910
so many years with his daughter, overcoming
the extra difficulties

1
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:57,340
that are now stopping so many cubans from
stepping foot on american soil. barbara alston

1
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:15,240
- lead singer of the ‘60s us girl-group
- the crystals - has died at the age of 7a.

1
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,680
and there's no other like my baby. she died
a week ago in north carolina after contracting

1
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:28,180
flu - but the news has only now emerged. tributes
are also being paid to eddy amoo of the band

1
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:43,900
the real thing - who has also died aged 7a.
famous for hits like you to me are everything

1
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,410
in the ‘70s, the band were considered pioneers

1
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:55,320
in the uk music industry after becoming the
first all-black band to reach number one.

1
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:01,519
as we've been hearing - the united states
has unveiled it highlights once again the

1
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:09,539
tense relationship between pyongyang about
the regime - and its people. but a new exhibition

1
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:16,901
opening in london is aiming to change that
- as the bbc’s tim allman explains. when

1
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:23,000
you think of north korea, these are the sort
of images that probably come to mind. military

1
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,640
parades, precision marching, a closed off
isolated country, and a mystery to the rest

1
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,420
of the world. that is why this exhibition
is such an eye-opener. it is trying to provide

1
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:41,480
some insight into what life is really like
for north koreans. we do not understand north

1
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,079
korea, it is a very complicated country. we
understand elements of it but we tend to have

1
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,079
a very

1
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,319
black-and-white viewpoint, so i think this
is one of these elements that if we start

1
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,129
to understand it, it will improve our knowledge
gap. there are propaganda posters, packaging

1
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,590
for sweets and soft drinks, even packets of
north korean sugar. it is not all inward looking,

1
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:10,599
there are a collection of stamps featuring
princess dianajlade. william. i would be very

1
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,919
worried if people saw them and then decided
to defect to north korea, but i think it is

1
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,460
going to be more likely that people will understand
more and want to understand more. because

1
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:29,250
it is that lack of knowledge in the world
today that creates trouble. for so many people,

1
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:35,369
north korea has become an enigma. its people
are unknowable, its future uncertain. but

1
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:47,819
this exhibition could change thatjust a little.
nearly a thousand topless men have braved

1
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:48,849
the sub-zero temperatures

1
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:54,740
in belarus for a running race to celebrate
"men's day". the snow and ice was no obstacle

1
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,789
for the men, as they sprinted through the
streets of minsk, shuba krishnan reports.

1
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:09,859
it is a race like no other. 1000 shirtless
men running through the icy streets of minsk

1
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:20,769
in -10 celsius. well, it is all in celebration
of their manhood, of course. translation:

1
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:30,289
it is an exciting event that really allows
you are worth something. it is a big challenge

1
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:41,490
for our guys and for me personally. of the
defender of the fatherland. the event originated

1
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:51,400
in russia in 1918, when the red army was created.
it has now transformed into a day that honours

1
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,820
men as a whole. translation: it does not matter
whether you did military service or not. the

1
00:24:55,819 --> 00:25:04,409
atmosphere of the day is great, the race is
great. it is beautiful. and it looks like

1
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:15,040
many of the spectators certainly agree with
that. many of them already have decent muscles...

1
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:23,559
why try to prove more by plunging into freezing
don't forget you can get in touch with me

1
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:43,379
and some of the team on twitter, i'm @nkemifejika.
i shall be wearing a warm jacket to away from

1
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
the cold.

1
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:53,000
hello there. and about, if you are appropriately
dressed. the skies will often be blue, but

1
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,220
underneath those blue skies it is going to
feel chilly, particularly when we add in the

1
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,460
strength of a biting cold easterly wind. now,
we start saturday morning on a very chilly

1
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,049
note. you can see the blue colours on the
chart here. a widespread frost, temperatures

1
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:16,200
below freezing for many. perhaps not quite
as cold for northern ireland, that shows where

1
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,450
we have a touch of frost to start the day.
now, that frost will slowly melt away to reveal

1
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,549
a lot of dry weather and some spells of sunshine.
but, with that chilly breeze down towards

1
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:31,059
the south, it is going to feel quite cold,
despite the fact that temperatures on the

1
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:35,179
thermometer will get up to. around six, possibly
seven degrees in places.

1
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,269
always more cloud across parts of south devon
and cornwall but sunny skies for much of wales

1
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,730
and northern england. northern ireland brightening
up after the cloudy start and things turning

1
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,970
brighter again after a cloudy start in western
scotland. in eastern scotland up towards the

1
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,500
northern isles, we should see a fair amount
of sunshine. then we go through saturday night,

1
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,200
we do it all again underneath these largely
clear skies. it is going to turn cold. perhaps

1
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,460
at this stage, a little more cloud feeding
in towards parts of eastern scotland and north-east

1
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,360
england. notice still some green shading on
the map here. maybe not quite as cold underneath

1
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,679
the cloud. the chilliest weather will be underneath
those clear skies. so again, here's the frost

1
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,570
to start sunday morning. that frost only slowly
lifting as temperatures rise pretty slowly

1
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,000
on sunday morning. but then again, a lot of
sunshine. but that extra cloud for eastern

1
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,700
scotland and parts of north-east england could
start to produce the odd snow flurry. still

1
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,430
with that chilly feel, still that cold easterly
wind, particularly noticeable in the south.

1
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,890
so when we add on the strength of the wind,
this is what it will feel like - subzero for

1
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:42,210
the likes of birmingham and norwich. and that's
because we're going to be bringing the air

1
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,140
all the way from siberia.

1
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,450
we really start to tap into that very cold
air as we head into the new working week.

1
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,210
not only will it be cold, with temperatures
struggling to get above freezing even by day,

1
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,210
there is the increasing chance of some snow
showers, particularly in eastern areas initially.

1
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:06,039
perhaps some areas with more persistent snow
at times, but even further west, not completely

1
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:10,309
exempt. perhaps not quite as many showers
but just about anywhere, we will have the

1
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:12,109
potential for a little bit of snow. so, to
sum up things for next week, it'll be very

1
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,709
cold with bitter winds. some snow at times
and widespread frost and ice

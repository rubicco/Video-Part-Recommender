1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,179
Ezra Klein: So let’s begin with the economy.

1
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:07,458
We're in a point where the economy is growing.

1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,359
We have very high corporate profits.

1
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,939
We have a record stock market, and yet for
decades now we've not been seeing significant

1
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:16,870
wage increases for the American people.

1
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,219
How have we gotten to a point where we can
have high corporate profits, and businesses

1
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:25,410
can be doing so well, but the workers don't
necessarily share in that prosperity?

1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,750
Barack Obama: Well, this has been at least
a three-decade-long trend.

1
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,910
And this was a major topic in my State of
the Union address.

1
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:39,049
We obviously came in at a time of enormous
crisis, and the first task was making sure

1
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:41,649
we didn't have a complete global economic
meltdown.

1
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:46,390
The steps we took, whether making sure the
financial system was functioning — saving

1
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,140
the auto industry, encouraging state and local
spending.

1
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,820
All those things made a difference in buoying
the economy, and then it’s been a hard but

1
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,170
steady slog to the point where now we're growing
at a robust pace and unemployment has come

1
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,350
down faster than any time in the last 30 years.

1
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:13,589
In some ways we're now back to the position
where we can focus on what is this longer-term

1
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,750
trend, and that is a larger and larger share
of wealth and income going to the very top,

1
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,579
and the middle class or folks trying to get
into the middle class, feeling increasingly

1
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,549
squeezed because their wages have stagnated.

1
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,069
Now, there are a whole bunch of reasons for
that.

1
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:36,899
Some of it has to do with technology and entire
job sectors being eliminated: travel agents,

1
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,980
bank tellers, a lot of middle management,
because of efficiencies with the internet

1
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,090
and a paperless office.

1
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,780
A lot of it has to do with globalization and
the rest of the world catching up.

1
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:57,049
Post-World War II, we just had some enormous
structural advantages because our competitors

1
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:02,469
had been devastated by war, and we had also
made investments that put us ahead of the

1
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:06,140
curve, whether in education or infrastructure
or research and development.

1
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:15,960
And around the ‘70s and ‘80s and then
accelerating beyond that, those advantages

1
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,680
went away at the same time as, because of
technologies, companies are getting a lot

1
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,090
more efficient and one last component of this
is that workers increasingly had less leverage

1
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,379
because of changes in labor laws and the ability
for capital to move and labor not to move.

1
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:37,159
 You combine all that stuff and it’s put
workers in a tougher position.

1
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:49,620
So our job now is to create additional tools
that, number one, make sure that everybody's

1
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,960
got a baseline of support to be able to succeed
in a constantly moving economy.

1
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,510
Whether it’s healthcare that survives job
loss, whether it is making sure we have child

1
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:10,840
care that allows a two-working-household-family
to prosper while still caring for their kids.

1
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,180
Having a certain baseline in terms of wages,
through the minimum wage.

1
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,180
So that's one set of issues.

1
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,180
A second set of issues then becomes: how do
we make sure that everybody has the tools

1
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,740
to succeed in an economy where they constantly
have to adapt?

1
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,850
And how do they move up the value chain, essentially
because they can work in higher-wage, higher-skill

1
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:36,409
professions, and were able to compete for
those jobs internationally?

1
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,289
Then the third thing is making sure that we
have an economy that's productive.

1
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:46,629
Now if we do all those things, then what I'm
confident about is that we can continue to

1
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:51,620
lower the unemployment rate, increase the
participation rate, and continue to grow and

1
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,819
increase productivity.

1
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:59,899
We're still going to have a broader, longer
term, global question and that is: how do

1
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,520
we make sure that the folks at the very top
are doing enough of their fair share?

1
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:13,689
The winner-take-all aspect of this modern
economy means that you've got some people

1
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:17,389
who just control enormous amounts of wealth.

1
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,220
We don't really resent their success, on the
other hand just as a practical matter, if

1
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,260
we're going to pay for schools, roads, et
cetera, and you've got you know, fifty people

1
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:31,689
or eighty people having as much wealth as
three billion, you know you're going to have

1
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:38,009
problems making sure that we're investing
enough in the common good to be able to move

1
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,009
forward.

1
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,099
 So that's a long term question.

1
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,870
 But right now, there's some very specific
things we can do that can makes a difference

1
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,810
and help middle class families.

1
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,850
And that's why I called it middle-class economics.

1
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,850
 

1
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,180
Ezra: To focus a bit on that long term question,
does that put us in a place long term where

1
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,250
redistribution becomes, in a sense, a positive
good in and of itself, that you have an economy

1
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,439
or potentially you have the government playing
the role not of powering the growth engine

1
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,649
which is what a lot of what had to be done
after the financial crisis, but of making

1
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:12,239
sure that while that growth engine is running,
that it is ensuring that enough of the gains

1
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,930
and prosperity is shared that the political
support for that fundamental economic model

1
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,129
to remain strong?

1
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,269
Obama: That's always been the case.

1
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,849
I don't think that's entirely new.

1
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:27,340
The fact of the matter is that relative to
our post-war history, taxes now are not particularly

1
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:33,829
high or particularly progressive compared
to what they were, say, in the late ‘50s

1
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:34,829
or the ‘60s.

1
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:40,859
And there's always been this notion that for
a country to thrive, there are some things,

1
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,910
as Lincoln says, that we can do better together
than we can do for ourselves.

1
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,650
And whether that's building roads, or setting
up effective power grids, or making sure that

1
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,829
we've got high quality public education, that
teachers are paid enough, the market will

1
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:57,019
not cover those things.

1
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:58,198
And we've got to do them together.

1
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,699
Basic research falls in that category.

1
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,349
So that's always been true.

1
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,260
I think that part of what's changed is that
a lot of that burden for making sure that

1
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,319
the pie was broadly shared took place before
government even got involved.

1
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,819
If you had stronger unions, you had higher
wages.

1
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:23,370
If you had a corporate culture that felt a
sense of place and commitment so that the

1
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:33,399
CEO was in Pittsburgh or was in Detroit and
felt obliged, partly because of social pressure

1
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,459
but partly because they felt a real affinity
toward the community, to re-invest in that

1
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:41,189
community and to be seen as a good corporate
citizen.

1
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:49,040
 Today what you have is quarterly earning
reports, compensation levels for CEOs that

1
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:58,449
are tied directly to those quarterly earnings,
you've got international capital that is demanding

1
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,990
maximizing short term profits.

1
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:11,110
And so what happens is that a lot of the distributional
questions that used to be handled in the marketplace

1
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:19,110
through decent wages or health care or defined
benefit pension plans, those things all are

1
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,460
eliminated.

1
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,509
And the average employee, the average worker,
doesn't feel any benefit.

1
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,060
So part of our job is what can government
do directly through tax policy?

1
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,509
What we’ve proposed, for example, in terms
of capital gains.

1
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:39,349
That would make a big difference in our capacity
to give a tax break to a working mom for child

1
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,350
care.

1
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:46,830
And that's smart policy, and there's no evidence
that would hurt the incentives of folks at

1
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:52,709
Google or Microsoft or Uber not to invent
what they invent or not to provide services

1
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,709
they provide.

1
00:07:53,709 --> 00:08:02,198
It just means that instead of 20 billion dollars,
maybe they've got 18.

1
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,199
Right?

1
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,580
 But it does mean that mom can go to work
without worrying that her kid's not in a safe

1
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,109
place.

1
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,110
 

1
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,670
We also still have to focus on the front end.

1
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:21,000
Which is even before taxes are paid, are there
ways that we can increase the bargaining power

1
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,689
and the -- making sure that an employee has
some ... measurable increases in their incomes

1
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:34,820
and their wealth and their security as a consequence
of an economy that's improving.

1
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:42,959
 And that's where issues like labor laws
make a difference, that's where, say in shareholder

1
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:50,828
meetings,and trying to change the culture
in terms of compensation at the corporate

1
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:51,828
level.

1
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:52,828
Those things could make a difference.

1
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:57,919
And there's been some interesting conversations
globally around issues like inclusive capitalism

1
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,009
and how we can make it work for everybody.

1
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:04,480
Ezra: When you drill into that pretax portion,
one thing you can find in wages is health

1
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
care costs.

1
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Obama: Yeah.

1
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,938
Ezra: And when you drill deeper into the health
care costs, one thing you find is that a major

1
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:16,458
piece of why Americans pay so much more is
that when we go to a hospital, an MRI, or

1
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:22,198
an appendectomy, or even a bottle of cholesterol
drugs, just costs much more for an American

1
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:25,919
to buy than it does in Germany, in Japan,
in Canada, in Great Britain.

1
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,909
Why do you think Americans pay so much higher
health care prices than folks in other countries?

1
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:34,058
Obama: Well, you know there are a lot of theories
about this.

1
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:38,769
But I think the evidence points to a couple
of key factors.

1
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,778
One is that we've got a third-party system.

1
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:46,088
Mostly we've got a system where everybody
gets their health insurance through their

1
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:47,339
employers.

1
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,690
Obviously the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,
helps to cover the gap for those who aren't

1
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,319
in that system.

1
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:59,539
But for those of us who have an insurer, we
don't track it.

1
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:08,838
And the market then becomes really opaque
and really hard to penetrate.

1
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:17,889
Health providers are able to, I think, charge
without much fear that somebody's looking

1
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,560
over their shoulders and asking well why does
this cost that much?

1
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,558
So that's part of it.

1
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:29,969
That's one of the reasons the Affordable Care
Act, a lot of the attention’s been on making

1
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,259
sure that the uninsured have peace of mind,
and people who currently have insurance but

1
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:39,379
at some point might lose it or have pre-existing
conditions are going to have it, that's obviously

1
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:45,028
the moral basis for what we did.

1
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:49,249
But people haven't been paying as much attention
to the delivery system reforms that we're

1
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,339
trying to institute through the Affordable
Care Act as well.

1
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,339
I can't take credit for all four years of
the lowest health care inflation in the last

1
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,209
fifty, that we've seen since the Affordable
Care Act passed.

1
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:05,058
Some of the trends I think were already on
their way.

1
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:10,600
But we are accelerating a lot of reforms,
for example.

1
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,619
What do we do to make sure that instead of
paying a doctor of a hospital for just providing

1
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:22,509
a service, let’s make sure that they're
being rewarded for a good outcome?

1
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:30,230
Which may mean in some cases fewer tests or
a less expensive generic drug, or just making

1
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,909
sure that all your employees are washing your
hands so that you're cutting the infection

1
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:41,999
rate, or making sure that hospitals are reimbursed
when there's a lower readmissions rate, as

1
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,409
opposed to when they're doing more stuff.

1
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:53,798
And using Medicare as a lever, I think, is
creating an environment in the health care

1
00:11:53,798 --> 00:12:05,208
field where we can start getting better outcomes
and lower costs at the same time.

1
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:12,349
There are still going to be those who argue
that unless you get a single-payer system,

1
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,819
you're never going to get all the efficiencies.

1
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:22,099
There's certain areas like drugs where the
fact that Congress has not been, and the Republican

1
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:30,009
Party in particular, has been resistant to
letting drug makers and Medicare negotiate

1
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:32,278
for the lowest price.

1
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:39,220
It results in us paying a lot more than we
should.

1
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,579
 But if we're paying four, five, six, eight
percent more than other countries for the

1
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:51,938
same outcomes, I'd be pretty happy where we're
only paying two or three percent more.

1
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:56,480
Because that represents hundreds of billions
of dollars and means we can do a lot with

1
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
that money.

1
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,369
Ezra: When you talk about Medicare as a lever,
Medicare tends to pay a lot less per service

1
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:04,739
than private insurers by a margin.

1
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:09,689
Before single payer there's also this idea
you hear occasionally of letting private insurers

1
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:14,058
band together with Medicare, with Medicaid,
to jointly negotiate prices.

1
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,469
Do you think that's a good idea?

1
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:27,750
Obama: You know, I think that moving in the
direction where consumers and others can have

1
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,119
more power in the marketplace, particularly
when it comes to drugs, makes a lot of sense.

1
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:38,620
 Now you'll hear from the drug companies
that part of the reasons other countries pay

1
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,298
less for drugs is they don't innovate.

1
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:47,659
We essentially through our system, subsidize
the innovation and other countries are free

1
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,469
riders.

1
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,309
There's probably a little bit of truth to
that but when you look at the number of breakthrough

1
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:58,278
drugs and the amount of money that drug companies
now are putting into research and where they're

1
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:07,298
putting it, a whole lot of it is actually
in redesigning, modestly, existing drugs so

1
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:11,578
they can renew patents and maintain higher
prices and higher profits.

1
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:14,039
That's not entirely true... but there's some
of that.

1
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:20,219
So there is a lot of savings that could be
achieved while still making sure that our

1
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,569
drug industry is the best in the world, and
will still be making a healthy profit.

1
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:29,058
Ezra: To turn a bit towards politics, at this
point according to the polls, you are the

1
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:32,678
most polarizing president really since we
began polling, but before you the record was

1
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:37,249
set by George W. Bush, and before George W.
Bush the record was set by Bill Clinton.

1
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:41,308
It seems that there's something structural
happening there in terms party polarization

1
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:45,999
and the way it affects approval ratings and
cooperation with presidents.

1
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:51,359
In your State of the Union you struck back
at critics who say that the idea of healing

1
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:55,239
some of these divisions is naïve or impossible.

1
00:14:55,239 --> 00:15:00,619
So when you welcome your successor into office,
what would you tell them there is worth trying

1
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:04,579
to that you think that can still work, that
would reduce the polarization?

1
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:11,948
Obama: Well, there are a couple of things
that in my mind, at least, contribute to our

1
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:17,448
politics being more polarized than people
actually are.

1
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:20,708
And I think most people just sense this in
their daily lives.

1
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:30,618
Everybody's got a family member or a really
good friend from high school who is on the

1
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:34,119
complete opposite side of the political spectrum.

1
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:36,928
And yet, we still love them, right?

1
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:42,639
 Everybody goes to a soccer game, or watching
their kids, coaching, and they see parents

1
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,778
who they think are wonderful people and then
if they made a comment about politics suddenly

1
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,509
they'd go, 'I can't believe you think that!'

1
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:56,879
 But a lot of it has to do with the fact
that a) the balkanization of the media means

1
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,899
that we just don't have a common place where
we get common facts and a common world view

1
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:06,039
the way we did twenty, thirty years ago.

1
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,708
And that just keeps on accelerating, you know,
and I'm not the first to observe this but

1
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:15,498
you've got the Fox News Rush Limbaugh folks
and then you've got the MSNBC folks and the

1
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:21,798
-- I dunno where Vox falls into that, but
you guys are I guess for the brainiac nerd

1
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:23,869
types.

1
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:30,519
But the point is that technology which brings
the world to us also allows us to narrow our

1
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,698
point of view.

1
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:33,349
That's contributed to it.

1
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,649
Gerrymandering contributes to it.

1
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:41,159
There's no incentive for most members of congress,
on the House side at least, in congressional

1
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,499
districts, to even bother trying to appeal.

1
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:47,100
And a lot of it has to do with just unlimited
money.

1
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:56,850
So people are absorbing an entirely different
reality when it comes to politics, even though

1
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,329
the way they're living their lives and interacting
with each other isn't that polarizing.

1
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:12,578
So my advice to a future president is increasingly
try to bypass the traditional venues that

1
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:21,099
create divisions and try to find new venues
within this new media that are quirkier, less

1
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,669
predictable.

1
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:29,700
You know yesterday I did three interviews
with YouTube stars that generally don't spend

1
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,250
a lot of time talking about politics.

1
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:37,299
And the reason we did it is because they're
reaching viewers who don't want to be put

1
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:41,990
in some particular camp, on the other hand
when you talk to them very specifically about

1
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,660
college costs or about health care or about
any of the other things that touch on their

1
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,769
individual lives, it turns out that you can
probably build a pretty good consensus.

1
00:17:52,769 --> 00:18:02,809
Now that doesn't ignore the fact that I would
love to see some constitutional process that

1
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:11,079
would allow us to actually regulate campaign
spending the way we used to, and maybe even

1
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,179
improve it.

1
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,850
I'd love to see changes at the state level
that reduce political gerrymandering.

1
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:21,559
So there's all kinds of structural things
that I'd like to see that I think would improve

1
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,500
this, but, you know there’ve been periods
in the past where we've been pretty polarized.

1
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,450
I think, there just wasn't polling around.

1
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,400
As I recall there was a whole civil war, that
was a good example of polarization that took

1
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
place.

1
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,220
Ezra: Do you think if we don't get some of
those structural reforms, and more to the

1
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,610
point if we continue along this path, in terms
of where the parties are in Congress, are

1
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,479
there ways to govern with polarization?

1
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,579
It occurs to me that your argument when you
came to office, but before you, Bush was a

1
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:54,319
"uniter not a divider" and before him Clinton
who was going to moderate and change the Democratic

1
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,099
party with his sort of Third Way approach,
the last couple of presidents have come to

1
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:02,759
office promising the way they would get things
done is to reduce polarization.

1
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:08,190
Is there an argument or an approach that can
be made to govern amidst polarization?

1
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,620
Obama: A couple observations.

1
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:17,409
 Number one is that in American history,
even during the so-called golden age where,

1
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,680
you know, you had liberal Republicans and
conservative Democrats and there was deal

1
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,150
cutting going on in Congress.

1
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,620
Generally speaking, big stuff didn't get done
unless there was a major crisis or you had

1
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:38,229
-- and/or you had big majorities of one party
controlling the Congress and a president of

1
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,230
the same party.

1
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,620
I mean that's just been the history.

1
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:46,849
There have been exceptions, but that's often
been the case in terms of big muscle movements

1
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:50,029
in the political system.

1
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:56,019
And you know, my first two years in office
when I had a Democratic majority and Democratic

1
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:03,309
house and Democratic Senate, we were as productive
as any time since Lyndon Johnson.

1
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,279
And when the majority went away stuff got
blocked.

1
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:15,289
Probably the one thing that we could change
without a constitutional amendment that would

1
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:21,569
make a difference here would be the elimination
of the routine use of the filibuster in the

1
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:22,569
Senate.

1
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:31,039
Because I think that does, in an era in which
the parties are more polarized, it almost

1
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:38,750
ensures greater gridlock and less clarity
in terms of the positions of the parties.

1
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,400
There's nothing in the constitution that requires
it.

1
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,060
The framers were pretty good about designing
a house, a senate, two years versus six year

1
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,210
terms, every state getting two senators.

1
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,759
There were a whole bunch of things in there
to assure that a majority didn't just run

1
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,759
rampant.

1
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,730
The filibuster in this modern age probably
just torques it too far in the direction of

1
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,920
a majority party not being able to govern
effectively and move forward its platform.

1
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,060
And i think that's an area where we can make
some improvement.

1
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:18,000
Ezra: One of the powerful things that's happened
as polarization has increased politically

1
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,559
is it's begun structuring people's other identities.

1
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,509
The one I'm particularly interested in here
is race.

1
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,640
If you look back at polling around the OJ
Simpson verdict or the Bernhard Goetz shooting

1
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,200
in New York, Republicans and Democrats you
basically couldn't tell them apart.

1
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,519
Now you look at the Zimmerman verdict or you
look at what's going on in Ferguson and opinion

1
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,889
on racial issues is very sharply split by
party.

1
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,950
 Do you worry about the merging of sort of
racial and partisan identity?

1
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,670
Obama: I don't worry about that because I
don't think that's going to last.

1
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:56,779
I worry very much about the immediate consequences
of mistrust between police and minority communities.

1
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:03,299
I think there are things we can do to train
our police force and make sure that everybody

1
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,430
is being treated fairly.

1
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:13,610
And the task force that I assigned after the
Ferguson and New York cases is intended to

1
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:18,109
produce very specific tools for us to deal
with it.

1
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:26,339
But over the long term, I'm pretty optimistic
and the reason is because this country just

1
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,789
becomes more and more of a hodge-podge of
folks.

1
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:41,509
Again, this is an example where things seem
very polarized at the national level and media

1
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:45,859
spotlight, but you go into communities -- you
know one of the great things about being president

1
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:52,109
is you travel through the entire country and
you go to Tennessee and it turns out that

1
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,879
you've got this huge Kurdish community.

1
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:07,620
And you go to some little town in Iowa and
you see some hasidic Jewish community, and

1
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:13,500
then you see a bunch of interracial black
and white couples running around with their

1
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
kids.

1
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,160
And this is in these little farm communities
and you've got Latinos in the classroom when

1
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,670
you visit the schools there.

1
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:30,700
 So people are getting more and more comfortable
with the diversity of this country, much more

1
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:37,809
sophisticated about both the cultural differences
but more importantly the basic commonality

1
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,779
that we have.

1
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:48,129
And you know the key is to make sure that
our politics and our politicians are tapping

1
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:55,050
into that better set of impulses rather than
our baser fears.

1
00:23:55,049 --> 00:24:05,490
And my gut tells me, and I've seen it in my
own career and you see it generally, a politician

1
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:12,319
who plays on those fears in America, I don't
think is gonna over time get a lot of traction.

1
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:20,279
Even, you know, it's not a perfect analogy
but if you think about how rapidly the whole

1
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:27,730
issue of the LGBT community and discrimination
against gays and lesbians has shifted.

1
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:39,440
The Republican party, even the most conservative,
they have much less ability I think to express

1
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,490
discriminatory views than they did even 10
years ago.

1
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,579
And that's a source of optimism.

1
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:49,859
It makes me hopeful.

1
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,029
Ezra: On Obamacare, something that members
of your administration have always said, and

1
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:57,389
I think you may have said, there's been a
lot of language about it being a good start,

1
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,750
a platform to begin building.

1
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,990
It's full of experiments, the idea is that
there will be learning, and there will be

1
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,990
change.

1
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,309
It's been going -- now we're in the second
year of open enrollment -- what would you

1
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:12,269
like to see, if Congress were able to take
up a bill, to tweak, to improve, to change,

1
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:13,680
to build on that platform.

1
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,470
What specifically from what you wanted in
there originally or what we've learned since

1
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,470
it's actually been in operation.

1
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,319
How would you like to see it improved?

1
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:31,460
Obama: Well, I'm not sure, Ezra, that we've
got enough years of it being in place to know

1
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,120
perfectly what needs to be improved, where
there's still gaps.

1
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,359
 It's been a year.

1
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,639
So far the verdict is that this thing's working
for a lot of people.

1
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,250
 You've got 10 million people who've been
enrolled, you've got more folks who've been

1
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:53,410
signed up for the expanded Medicaid coverage,
you've seen health care inflation stay low

1
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:00,680
or actually be significantly lower than before
the ACA was passed, satisfaction with the

1
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,160
insurance seems to be high.

1
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:10,019
We haven't seen major disruptions to the medical
system that a lot of people had predicted.

1
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,410
So, there's a lot of stuff that's working.

1
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:23,810
Over time, I think seeing if we can do more
on delivery system reform, making sure that

1
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:27,649
we fill the gaps in those states that haven't
expanded Medicaid.

1
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:34,740
The big problem we have right now with Obamacare
is that it was designed to make sure that

1
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,049
some subset of people qualified for Medicaid
and that's how that's how they were going

1
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:43,259
to get coverage, and others were going to
go into the exchanges because they had slightly

1
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:44,259
higher incomes.

1
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:51,730
And because of the decision of the Roberts
court that we couldn't incentivize states

1
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:58,990
to expand Medicaid the way we had originally
intended, you’ve got a lot of really big

1
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:04,950
states, you've got tens of millions of people
who aren't able to get their Medicaid coverage.

1
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,840
And so there's this gap.

1
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,259
And that's probably the biggest challenge
for us.

1
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:18,839
The good news is in dribs and drabs, much
as was true with the original Medicaid program,

1
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:24,389
you're starting to see Republican Governor
and Republican State Legislatures realize

1
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,180
that we're cutting off our nose to spite our
face.

1
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:34,080
We've got an ideological objection to us helping
our own constituencies and our own health

1
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,079
care systems.

1
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:42,819
And to their credit, you've got folks like
John Kasich in Ohio and Snyder in Michigan

1
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:48,599
and now, most recently the governor up in
Alaska and others who are saying ‘You know

1
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,990
what this is the right thing to do.

1
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,420
Let’s go ahead and expand it.’

1
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,460
So until that kind of settles, I don't think
we'll fully know where there's still gaps

1
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,850
in coverage, what more we still need to do.

1
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:14,160
But I think that so far, at least, the performance
of the plans itself, not the website in the

1
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:21,940
first three months but the performance of
the actual plans, you know has at least met

1
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,710
and perhaps exceeded a lot of people's expectations.

1
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,920
The website, by the way, works great now.

1
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,160
Ezra: I'm going to tag out and let Matt in.

1
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:38,500
Thank you very much for taking the time, sir.

1
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,740
Obama: Thank you, really enjoyed it.

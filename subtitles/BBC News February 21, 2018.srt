1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:08,719
this is the briefing.

1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,050
i'm sally bundock.

1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,019
our top stories: president trump says he wants
to ban bump-stock devices that turn rifles

1
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,059
into rapid-fire weapons.

1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:23,909
is that enough for survivors of the florida
school shooting?

1
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,929
controlling the nile - at a cost.

1
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:33,000
concerns that africa's biggest hydroelectric
dam could provoke a regional conflict.

1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,009
no thaw in relations between the us and north
korea.

1
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:42,210
washington says pyongyang pulled out of high
level talks in seoul at the last minute.

1
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,429
and a front row seat at london fashion week.

1
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:49,850
the queen makes a surprise appearance.

1
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,600
in business briefing, south korea signs trade
deals with central american countries - but

1
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,060
can they offer a back door into the us as
tensions grow between the two?

1
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,289
plus the pressure intensifies

1
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,938
on prime minister may as she faces a fresh
outcry from more than sixty mpâ€™s in her

1
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:29,699
party demanding a hard brexit - we'll have

1
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
the latest.

1
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,980
a warm welcome to the programme, briefing
you on all you need to know in global news,

1
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,170
business, and sport. and you can be part of
the conversation.

1
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,478
after the queen stole the show at london fashion
week and presented her new award for emerging

1
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,228
british designers, we're asking you - how
would you encourage young talent?

1
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:51,228
do tell us what you think.

1
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:57,728
just use the hashtag #bbcthebriefing.

1
00:01:57,728 --> 00:02:05,650
so let's it started.

1
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,969
-- get.

1
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:15,438
apparently in response to a growing gun control
campaign by high school students, president

1
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:22,150
trump has expressed his willingness to ban
the so-called "bump stock" mechanism, which

1
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,500
turns a rifle into something very close to
a machine gun.

1
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,139
bump stocks allow a rifle to shoot in almost
automatic bursts, and were used by the gunman

1
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,919
who shot dead 58 people in las vegas in october.

1
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,149
laura westbrook reports.

1
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,230
they are mobilised and organised, and they
are demanding lawmakers in their state of

1
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:48,629
florida take action on gun control.

1
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:51,829
3000 kids in one school?

1
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,879
that's a big family enough.

1
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,030
and having a lot of the nation coming and
supporting us, too, that's what is changing.

1
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,709
like we're able to have that voice,

1
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,659
and we're able to be heard.

1
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,099
the president says he is listening.

1
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,919
i signed a memorandum directing the attorney
general to propose regulations to ban all

1
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,449
devices that turn legal weapons into machine-guns.

1
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:24,250
i expect that these critical regulations will
be finalised very soon.

1
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:31,598
so-called "bump stocks" allow semiautomatic
guns to be modified to fire hundreds of rounds

1
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,769
every minute.

1
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:38,269
the devices were used by the man who killed
58 people in las vegas last september.

1
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:39,269
-- 0ctober.

1
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,659
chanting: enough is enough! it's a sign that
the president is feeling the pressure from

1
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:50,209
these young voices.

1
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,199
here he is, a year ago, at a rally hosted
by the national rifle association.

1
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,229
they gave millions of dollars towards the
trump campaign.

1
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:06,530
so let me make a simple promise to every one
of the freedom-loving americans in the audience

1
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,729
today.

1
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:17,899
as your president, i will never, ever infringe
on the right of people to keep and bear arms.

1
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,060
never ever.

1
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,009
it remains to be seen if congress will push
through any new legislation.

1
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:32,389
so far, the nra have successfully resisted
every move to tighten gun controls.

1
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:37,918
but the children who are targets of school
shootings are hoping they can make it harderfor

1
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,319
this kind of tragedy to happen again.

1
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:47,478
another funeral was held for 15-year-old peter
wang. he was killed while trying to help others

1
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:53,360
escape, and honoured by being posthumously
accepted into his dream school, the westpoint

1
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,930
academy.

1
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,840
laura westbrook, bbc news.

1
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,959
many of you have already messaged

1
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,299
and said that you do not think that is enough.

1
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:14,550
the united nations in syria says it's deeply
worried for hundreds of thousands of people

1
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:22,530
trapped under a mounting government bombardment
of the rebel-held enclave of eastern ghouta.

1
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:28,109
the un said it feared a second aleppo, the
syrian city recaptured in a government offensive

1
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,949
in 2016.

1
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:36,829
activists said at least 250 people had been
killed in eastern ghouta since sunday night,

1
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:44,930
the highest 48-hour total in the syrian conflict
since 2013.

1
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:57,230
the drones target the areas here, and target
the civilians, and the crowded neighbourhood.

1
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,410
they want to

1
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,528
kill iran here.

1
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:05,389
-- everyone.

1
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:11,150
the project to build africa's biggest hydroelectric
dam on the river nile is threatening to provoke

1
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:14,989
a major conflict between some of the countries
affected.

1
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,960
the dam is being build by ethiopia and sudan
says it welcomes the prospect of cheaper power

1
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,969
and the ability to reduce flooding in its
vast irrigation projects.

1
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:33,330
but the egyptians are deeply unhappy fearing
the flow through the aswan dam and on to cairo

1
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:38,448
will be weakened in a country already facing
serious water shortages.

1
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:45,120
0ur africa correspondent alastair leithead
has travelled to all three countries and he

1
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,949
sent this special report.

1
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,169
the river nile is the world's lammas river.

1
00:06:52,168 --> 00:07:02,459
but these are turbulent times between three
countries that share it's like bringing water.

1
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,459
the source

1
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:07,409
is this.

1
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,620
five years in and to those built, this multi-
billion-dollar dam can already control the

1
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,250
flow of the nile, and that is what is upsetting
downstream egypt. when it is finished, this

1
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,930
will be the largest hydroelectric power station
in africa. in one of the biggest dams on the

1
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,930
continent.

1
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,038
it will not just power this country but the
surrounding countries as well.

1
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:33,050
if you have it did not even asked the country
â€˜s downstream before it started building.

1
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,660
that is the scale of this country's ambition.

1
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,910
the reservoir at rates will be bigger than
greater london.

1
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,710
hydroelectric dams do not consume water, but
if it is still too quickly, the flow of the

1
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:51,269
nile, 85% of which comes from here, will be
reduced.

1
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:55,418
ethiopianâ€™s obsessed with electrification.

1
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:58,120
70% of people here do not have power.

1
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,149
it is betting on economic growth and

1
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:04,929
industrial revolution, often at the cost of
human rights and freedom of speech, to destroy

1
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,240
its image of drought and speech, to destroy
its image of droughtand famine.

1
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,939
speech, to destroy its image of drought and
famine. it is an important project for ethiopia.

1
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:23,699
it is not about control and the flow, it is
really about an opportunity for us to develop

1
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,699
ourselves.

1
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,960
the powerlines are ready and waiting to ta
ke powerlines are ready and waiting to take

1
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,889
cheap sustainable energy.

1
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:42,479
at the great confluence of the blue-and-white
nile in khartoum, there are huge agricultural

1
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,670
projects under way.

1
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:50,169
much of this cattle feed is destined for the
goal.

1
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:53,899
the new dam would stop flooding and regulate
the river's flow.

1
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:59,089
it is the best thing that has happened for
a long

1
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,889
time.

1
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:09,769
regular water levels is a great blessing.

1
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,269
sudan has had a decades long deal with egypt.

1
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:17,350
but now it is in a conflict over how much
water it can use.

1
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,449
regional rivalries here go back to the pyramids.

1
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:26,219
egypt was once ruled from here thousands of
years ago.

1
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,769
hours on the nile rise and fall.

1
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,730
luxorâ€™s temples represent thousands of years
of egypt's powers set in temples represent

1
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,990
thousands of years of egyptâ€™s powers set
in stone, temples represent thousands of years

1
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,129
of egypt's powers set in stone, a proud symbol
of the nation's identity.

1
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:42,679
this man has been a fisherman on the nile
for years.

1
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,068
he is concerned.

1
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:55,068
translation: they said the 
water will not be affected, but only god knows

1
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,068
what will happen.

1
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,789
if they jammed the river, there will be wars

1
00:09:58,789 --> 00:09:59,789
and fighting.

1
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:00,789
but it is not a fee to be taken and fighting.

1
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:01,789
but it is not a fee to be ta ken lightly.
and fighting.

1
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:03,368
but it is not a fee to be taken lightly.

1
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,720
egypt relies on the nile for most of its water.

1
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,369
-- it is not a feud to be taken lightly.

1
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:16,809
ethiopia's dam makes them angry.

1
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:22,338
what does it mean? lost 200,000 acres of land.

1
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,730
one acre at least makes one family survive.

1
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,149
an average family size in egypt is about five
persons.

1
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:36,159
thei million would be jobless.

1
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,778
the impact of the dam has not been properly
assessed. in the battle between the power

1
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:45,458
of egypt and the emerging ambitions of ethiopia.

1
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,208
wars over water can be avoided with strong
leadership and diplomacy.

1
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:54,498
but now it is down to ethiopia, sudan, and
egypt, to navigate tensions on the world's

1
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:55,620
long as river.

1
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
-- longest.

1
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,440
let's brief you on some of the other stories
making the news.

1
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,459
american officials say the north korean leader's
sister was due to meet the us vice-president

1
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:13,508
for secret talks during the winter olympics,
but pulled out, less than two hours beforehand.

1
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,870
mike pence was apparently due to meet a delegation
from pyongyang but his officials claim it

1
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,629
was called off after he condemned human rights
abuses in the north.

1
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:29,139
we'll be speaking to our correspondent in
seoul later in the programme.

1
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:34,100
a lawyer from new york, who's the son-in-law
of one of russia's richest men, has admitted

1
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,810
lying to fbi agents investigating russian
attempts to interfere in the 2016 us presidential

1
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,298
election.

1
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:46,470
alex van der zwaan pleaded guilty to misleading
the fbi about his contacts with a former trump

1
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,589
campaign aide.

1
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,670
he'll be sentenced in april.

1
00:11:50,669 --> 00:12:00,759
now here in the uk, hardline brexiteers, led
by conservative mp jacob rees-mogg, are threatening

1
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,879
to withdraw there support for theresa may's
brexit plans

1
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:10,789
if they think they'll keep britain too closely
aligned to the eu. with me is henry bonsu

1
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:14,238
who's a broadcaster and international conference
host.

1
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:16,730
good to see you.

1
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:24,420
nash is under renewed pressure.

1
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,419
absolutely.

1
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:35,118
the title suggests a link, but it is anything
but.

1
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:43,850
there will be discussing exactly the nature
of the deal that the government is trying

1
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,470
to deal with the european union.

1
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:54,339
and whether or not they will be to change
the alignment. and the brexiteers, who number

1
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:59,110
of 60, about a fifth of the tory party, they
want

1
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,149
any limitation period to be based on wto principles.

1
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,120
that suggest they wa nt wto principles.

1
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,669
that suggest they want a hard brexit and everything
that goes with it.

1
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:14,818
in the meantime, it is critical to her that
she gets cabinet on board.

1
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:21,838
borisjohnson is a key player, foreign secretary.

1
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,470
david davis has been talking to business leaders
in various other places, and theresa may,

1
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,259
they are trained to get their message out
there.

1
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:38,068
the one yesterday by david davis indiana presented
a picture of a britain that was in lockstep

1
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:42,750
with the european union, not sliding towards
a dystopian mad max style future, he was trained

1
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,799
to reassure people that we we re was trained
to reassure people that we were not going

1
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:51,639
to take cliff edge, but this letter is in
stark contracts that.

1
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,879
henry will be back.

1
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,879
his cadaver coffee and he has other stories
get his head around.

1
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,879
we will talk you through those.

1
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,879
-- he is

1
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:05,519
going for a coffee.

1
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:18,769
and we look forward to the competition in
zhenjiang -- pyeongchang.

1
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:23,839
nine years and 15,000 deaths after going in
to afghanistan, the last soviet troops were

1
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,430
finally coming home.

1
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,769
the withdrawal completed in good order, but
the army defeated in the task it had been

1
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,769
sent to perform.

1
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,769
malcolm was murdered.

1
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:36,078
that has a terrible effect on the morale of
the people.

1
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,878
i'm terrified of the repercussions in the
streets.

1
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:53,829
one wonders who is next.

1
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:57,719
as the airlift got underway, there was no
let-up in the eruption itself.

1
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,850
lava streams from a vent low in the crater
flow down to the sea on the east of the island,

1
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,869
away from the town

1
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,670
for the time being, but it could start flowing
again at any time.

1
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:14,438
the russians heralded their new generation
space station with a spectacular night launch.

1
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:25,188
they've called it mir, the russian for peace.

1
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:26,188
you're watching the briefing.

1
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:29,769
our headlines: survivors of the florida school
shooting have arrived in the state capital

1
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,470
to push for gun control.

1
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:38,899
president trump says he wants to ban â€˜bump-stockâ€™
devices that turn rifles into rapid-fire weapons.

1
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:44,448
washington says north korea pulled out of
high level talks with the us at the last minute,

1
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:47,729
stifling hopes for a thaw in relations.

1
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,440
let's stay with that now.

1
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,759
let's speak to the bbcâ€™s stephen mcdonell
who's in the south korean capital, seoul.

1
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,548
we heard, we remember well the

1
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:04,860
speech of mike pence just before the winter
olympics started.

1
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,509
in some ways, it is not surprising to hear
that north korea was not happy with what he

1
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,509
had to say and will out of talk.

1
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,509
-- pulled out of talks.

1
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,402
what he had to say and will out of talk.

1
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,402
-- pulled out of talks.

1
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:25,139
this story of mike pence and the sister of
kimjong-un, kim yo-jong. it gets more fascinating,

1
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,259
there were secret effo rts more fascinating,
there were secret efforts behind the scenes

1
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:33,850
for them to meet and the north koreans pulled
out at the last minute.

1
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,850
i think washington has released details because
it is trying to counter the criticism that

1
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,040
mike pence came here and didn't reach out
to the north koreans, that this was a wasted

1
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,909
opportunity and he could have spoken to them.

1
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:53,519
if the white house version of events is correct,
it means he was sitting there in the main

1
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,009
stadium at the opening ceremony in front of
the north korean leader's sister, within handshakes

1
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:00,278
distance

1
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:03,539
and didn't even say something like see you
tomorrow.

1
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,058
at that point he still thought the meeting
was on.

1
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:12,139
it turns out the next day they were going
to meet at the blue house, a delegation from

1
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:18,020
the north korean side and the us side, but
at the dying moments, within hours before

1
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:21,599
the meeting was supposed to take place, the
north koreans pulled out.

1
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,879
this is on the same day that the invitation
came from kim jong-un via his sisterfor invitation

1
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,769
came from kim jong-un via his sister for south
korea's president to visit the north.

1
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:31,089
there area president to visit the north.

1
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:35,949
there are a lot of chess pieces being moved
around the board at this stage.

1
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,080
they are both reaching for the propaganda
high ground.

1
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:47,359
what this does show, i guess, that the attempt
by south korea's president to pull both sides

1
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:57,168
together, fabled. he apparently is the one
who has been the intermediary, suggesting

1
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:00,759
to mike pence that he meet with the north
korean. he will be

1
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,211
disappointed that that meeting didn't take
place.

1
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:07,859
i am sure there will be frustrating that that
didn't ta ke will be frustrating that that

1
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:08,879
didn't take place.

1
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
very delicate.

1
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,380
we will keep you up-to-date as we hear more.

1
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,480
slovakia angered the eu when it joined poland,
hungary and the czech republic in refusing

1
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,220
to accept migrant quotas.

1
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,769
these countries became known as the eu's trouble
makers, but slovakia actually favours closer

1
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:27,859
eu integration.

1
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:39,888
in the last of her series from the east of
the eu, jenny hill reports from slovakia.

1
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:43,119
this country is going places.

1
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:52,719
slovakia's and eu success story, foreign investment,
a soaring economy, the euros are pouring in.

1
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,730
no wonder perhaps, when brussels speaks, rattus
lover is all he is.

1
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,829
now is a big version of what has

1
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:10,710
happened with angela merkel, together with
emmanuel macron, put on the table this reform.

1
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:20,380
the communists are long gone, but it's socialist
past still casts a shadow.

1
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,559
translation: some things we did back then
and it would be good if they continued.

1
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:27,038
-- were good.

1
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:32,450
education and the health system work, but
we started to change everything to the western

1
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,330
way. in this region, slovakia often stands
alone, a flag bearerfor slovakia often stands

1
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:41,769
alone, a flag bearer for brussels and that
this was several reasons but perhaps the most

1
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,419
striking is this.

1
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:50,180
unlike its neighbours, poland, hungary, slovakia
doesn't have a strong nationalist voice.

1
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:56,950
rarely do slovaks feel that their country's
interest and those of the eu's are at odds.

1
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,630
u nless and those of the eu's are at odds.

1
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,750
unless you are talking about migrant quotas.

1
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,669
robert fico and his allies

1
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,669
oppose them.

1
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,929
translation: this union of prime ministers,
he says, doesn't wa nt of prime ministers,

1
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:13,160
he says, doesn't want was in communities created
in their countries.

1
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:21,850
but unlike poland, hungary and the czech republic,
that is where the anti-eu rhetoric stops.

1
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:28,428
in their logic, they are bringing slovakia
to the heart of europe as it means economic

1
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:37,600
benefits for the country and these are important
for providing jobs, but also protecting people.

1
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,648
unfortunately sometimes protecting means protecting
migrants orforeigners.

1
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:45,288
protecting means protecting migrants or foreigners.

1
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:47,609
and forging a different future.

1
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,839
new customers, it new investors.

1
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,138
-- new investors.

1
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:57,919
in the south, old injury -- industry left
behind, car manufacturers, among them, france

1
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,100
and germany pay

1
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,308
slovakia's bills now.

1
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:06,428
translation: living standards are not the
same as those in other member states.

1
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:09,528
in germany they earned four more times as
we do.

1
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:15,679
if we are talking about the european union,
it should equal.

1
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,639
life in the eu was supposed to look like this.

1
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:23,548
handouts for slovakia's roma, the wealth doesn't
flow this far.

1
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,119
translation: if anyone told me ten yea rs
far.

1
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,229
translation: if anyone told me ten years ago
that something like existed here in the 21st

1
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,778
century, i wouldn't have believed them.

1
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:36,069
people don't have drinking water, hot water
or even running water.

1
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:44,418
but here, on the margins of the eu, a country
dreams of getting to its heart.

1
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,840
jenny l, bbc news, practice lover.

1
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,839
-- bratislava.

1
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,389
here's our briefing on some of the key events
happening later.

1
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,929
we begin in paris where french

1
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:58,519
interior minister gerard collomb unveils a
controversial new bill on migrants and asylum

1
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,519
seekers.

1
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,720
it's believed he will push the uk to accept
more refugees and unaccompanied minors.

1
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,620
later in florida, students from marjory stoneman
douglas will march in the state capital of

1
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:15,969
tallahassee in the first organised protest
of their #neveragain movement.

1
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,829
17 people were left dead in a shooting at
the school last week.

1
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:25,148
and in london, the world's top musical talent
celebrate the 2018 brit awards.

1
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:27,768
dua lipa leads the pack with five nominations.

1
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:33,929
let's get the latest on the winter olympics
in pyongchang.

1
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:41,000
italy's sofia goggia won italy's first gold
with a win in the women's downhill.

1
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,538
norway's ragnhild mowinckel took silver and
the american - lindsey vonn - a former champion,

1
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:54,069
was pushed into 3rd place for bronze. in the
ladies figure skating, russia's15-year-old

1
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:57,378
alina zagitova is the favourite.

1
00:22:57,378 --> 00:23:02,648
the european champion faces strong competition
in the short programme from her team mate

1
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:06,158
evgenia medvedeva and canada's gabrielle daleman.

1
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,250
in curling, the final rounds for a place in
the semi finals are underway.

1
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,380
team gb women outplayed the reigning world
and olympic champions canada, but their victory

1
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,380
was only assured in the very final game.

1
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,269
the hosts korea are already through.

1
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:26,528
the men from team gb face the usa. the queen
has attended london fashion week for the first

1
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:33,419
time in her 66 year reign. she sat in the
front row of a show by an up-and-coming designer

1
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:42,259
richard quinn, next to the woman often hailed
as the queen of fashion, vogue magazine's

1
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:44,869
anna wintour.

1
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:48,789
virginia langeberg reports.

1
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:54,678
it was the queen's first visit to london fashion
week and, of course, her majesty made a show-stopping

1
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:57,769
entrance, bringing the audience to their feet.

1
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,950
after a few introductory words with the vip
guests, it was time to settle in.

1
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,179
those beside the monarch

1
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:09,540
were conscious to follow royal protocol before
taking their seats.

1
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,928
then it was showtime.

1
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,429
big and bold designs lit up the runway.

1
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:21,480
no crowds on this catwalk, but at least some
helmets to help hide any potential nerves.

1
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,798
never before has london fashion week's famous
power front row seen fashion royalty sit alongside

1
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,038
the queen herself.

1
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:35,249
her majesty, wearing a light blue tweed dress
and jacket, next to vogue's editor-in-chief,

1
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:36,879
dame anna wintour.

1
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:42,019
the pair sharing a laugh and keeping a close,
discerning eye on the show.

1
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:47,240
ms wintour opted to keep her sunglasses on,
but the queen's delight was captured in several

1
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,720
snaps and quickly beamed around the world,
causing the internet to heat up like never

1
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,390
before.

1
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,870
it was the last day of fashion week and they
were watching the work of emerging designer

1
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:03,609
richard quinn. he received the very first
queen elizabeth ii award

1
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,388
for british design.

1
00:25:05,388 --> 00:25:07,899
even he didn't believe the guest list when
he saw it.

1
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
it was really surreal.

1
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:15,710
before the show, you saw the names on this
blue cushion, and you're like, "oh, it's not

1
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:21,440
a prank, it's actually real!" the queen's
style was given a nod by the chief executive

1
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,740
of the british fashion council, who described
the 91-year-old monarch as a fashion icon.

1
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,899
speaking after the runway show, the queen
said her award for emerging designers will

1
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,119
be her legacy to british fashion.

1
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,538
virginia langeberg, bbc news.

1
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:44,509
we asked you, what would you try to do to
encourage young talent? we have got stephen

1
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,929
lang caster, he said given a big say.

1
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:50,769
i would encourage them, not put them down.

1
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:55,349
a man in india says good moments like these
do happen.

1
00:25:55,349 --> 00:26:00,808
the queen represents tradition and standard,
fashion is a trending lifestyle.

1
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:01,808
i

1
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:02,808
will see you in a moment.

1
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:07,069
thanks forjoining me.

1
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:13,798
time we updated you on the weather prospects
for the whole of the british isles over the

1
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:15,190
next few days or so.

1
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,990
fairly slow change, i would've thought, over
the next few days, simply because we are developing

1
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,349
an area of high pressure, which has rather
strangled the life out of the old weather

1
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,498
front, which provided quite a veil of cloud
sometimes through eastern parts of the british

1
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:34,089
isles through tuesday, but with the development
of the high pressure close by to the british

1
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:37,629
isles, that, as i say, has the effect of killing
off that front.

1
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,799
a veil of cloud, not much more than that.

1
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,450
maybe the odd drib and drab of rain, but essentially,
it's a dry pattern, and, increasingly, we'll

1
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,740
be talking about high pressure linked to the
one over scandinavia as we go through the

1
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,859
weekend and indeed into next week.

1
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:55,038
the veil of cloud doing its stuff to keep
temperatures above freezing across england

1
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:56,269
and wales for the most part.

1
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:59,628
scotland and northern ireland, a different
kettle of fish, someone's going to get to

1
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:01,009
Ã¢â‚¬Å“11 or -5.

1
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:02,419
so here we are on the new day.

1
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:03,778
a little bit of mist and fog around,

1
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:06,940
particularly in scotland and northern ireland,
but that will soon pop away.

1
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,110
essentially, it's a dry day.

1
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:13,298
maybe the odd spot of rain passing by, maybe
a shower coming in on the north-easterly breeze

1
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,048
towards kent and essex.

1
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:19,398
those temperatures, not too bad when you compare
them to what's to come, and i'll show you

1
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:21,199
those in just a second.

1
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,899
here is thursday.

1
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:27,898
just the first signs of us wanting to pick
up something a little bit sort of continental

1
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:28,898
in origin.

1
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:32,489
certainly, that wind coming in from a pretty
cool continent at the moment, and you'll feel

1
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,569
the like of that in norwich, for example,
4 degrees only, and generally across the british

1
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:42,038
isles, despite the fact there's a lot of sunshine
around, variable amounts of cloud, temperatures

1
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:45,480
just beginning to tick away from where we
were at the start of the week.

1
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,319
so as we move towards the tail end of the
week, things beginning to settle down.

1
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,819
notice temperatures around the 5, 6, 7-degree
mark or so.

1
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,200
the forecast in edinburgh rather caught my
eye.

1
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,380
that's the second big fixture of saturday
when we get round to the next round of the

1
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,389
six nations rugby.

1
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,500
i don't think the weather

1
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,940
will get in the way in dublin or, indeed,
in edinburgh. as i say, once we get towards

1
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:15,509
the weekend, our high pressure begins to become
amalgamated with a big area of high pressure

1
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:16,519
over scandinavia.

1
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:21,509
now, that's really quite important, because,
if you follow the isobars around the eastern

1
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:28,048
and southern flanks, then we begin to look
away, up towards siberia, for the source of

1
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:33,200
the air that comes towards us as we start
the new week, and that's really quite crucial.

1
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,490
we haven't seen that sort of setup for quite
a while, but there's no doubt about it.

1
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,240
next week, yes, there will be some sunshine,
there will be some chilly nights around.

1
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,720
a bitter wind in from the east and the chance
of snow as temperatures tumble.

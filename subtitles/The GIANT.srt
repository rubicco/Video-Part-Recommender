1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,699
a hundred and fifty years ago hardly
anyone in Europe had ever seen a living

1
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:14,428
African elephant and then an enormous
male arrived

1
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:23,420
his name was jumbo and his story is
extraordinary and dramatic

1
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,839
he was rumored to be the largest
elephant on the planet and his celebrity

1
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:35,439
status took him across the globe
millions flocked to see him during his

1
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,518
lifetime and it said that he inspired
Hollywood movies long after his death

1
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:47,768
but contemporary accounts reveal a
troubled life fueled by alcohol with

1
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:52,478
episodes of terrifying violence a near
mystical relationship with his keeper

1
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:59,378
and a tragic end that seems hard to
believe now I'm going to look beyond

1
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:07,329
Jumbo's celebrity for the real elephant
behind the myths how big was he in

1
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:13,560
reality and what is the truth behind the
mysteries that surround his tragic death

1
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,710
with access to Tambor's physical remains
those questions can finally be answered

1
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:24,809
and with the help of a team of
scientists elephant experts and

1
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,859
conservationists I will try to find out
how our understanding of elephants has

1
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,870
changed since jumpers time

1
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:40,329
this is a story of the world's first
animal superstar this is the story of

1
00:01:40,329 --> 00:02:10,289
jumbo

1
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:17,560
in 1882 a unique shipment is about to
arrive here in one of the busiest ports

1
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,159
in the world on board in a massive
wooden crate is an animal that has

1
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:30,669
already captured hearts in Britain
his name is jumbo and he's now all set

1
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:37,500
to become a superstar the most famous
animal in the world

1
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:50,019
my investigation into Jumbo's life
begins of the American Museum of Natural

1
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:59,769
History in New York there are elephant
skeletons on display here as in many

1
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:06,150
museums around the world but what I'm
looking for lies behind the scenes

1
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,079
Jumbos remains were brought here after
his death and are still among the most

1
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:17,010
treasured specimens in the collections

1
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:22,449
it's hard to think of a more famous
animal than jumbo I mean we have a lot

1
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:30,429
of famous specimens in the museum but
it's hard to imagine another specimen

1
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,060
that carries with it so much history so
much lore and legend

1
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:58,250
all these bans have been kept in the
museum's special temperature controlled

1
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:05,330
storage unit for decades unexamined but
now they're being brought out for

1
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:13,850
another look at them for the first time
in the history the museum has granted

1
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,649
access to Jumbo's skeleton for
scientific analysis and I'll be joining

1
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:23,269
an international team of researchers as
they attempt to answer some of the

1
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:31,339
mysteries that still surround this giant
3 one of the important things about

1
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:35,629
collections and the reason the museum
has great collections like this

1
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:43,009
including jumbo is that technologies
come about that allow you to relook at

1
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:49,069
these specimens in ways you never
imagined before among the team carrying

1
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:54,469
out this first-ever full survey of jumbo
is dr. Richard Thomas a researcher of

1
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,930
ancient animal bones from the University
of Leicester

1
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,009
with him is Professor John Hutchinson
from the Royal Veterinary College an

1
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:11,899
authority on locomotion in large land
animals finally dr. Holly Miller from

1
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:16,189
the University of Nottingham who will be
analyzing the chemical content of

1
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:22,000
Jumbo's bones tutus about his diet and
overall health

1
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:36,199
and this is what remains of jumbo

1
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,610
there are of course hundreds if not
thousands of elephant skeletons in

1
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,080
museums around the world so why should
this particular one be of special

1
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,759
interest
well when jumbo was alive many people

1
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,430
believed that he was the biggest living
land animal on earth certainly the

1
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:10,750
biggest that anyone had ever seen 20
million people came to see him and after

1
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:20,740
his death many continued to do so but
many mysteries remain exactly how big

1
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,980
was he and why did he have terrible fits
of rage and violence during the night

1
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,819
that led him to demolish the cages in
which he was kept and above all how did

1
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:41,329
he die even that is still a mystery

1
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:47,399
while the scientists across the Atlantic
begin their study of Jumbo's bones I am

1
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,419
looking through the archives of the
London Zoo to try and trace his story

1
00:06:51,420 --> 00:07:07,470
from Africa to Britain and ultimately to
America this register records every

1
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:16,470
important event at the London Zoo and
the entry for June 26th 1865 notes the

1
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:24,650
arrival of one African elephant it was
called jumbo the name in Swahili means

1
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:33,089
hello today because of this elephant the
word jumbo has come to mean something

1
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:39,239
that's extremely large but in fact jumbo
didn't arrive as a giant far from it

1
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,790
the first image of him here is as a
small orphan so how did he get here

1
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,199
during the 19th century new zoos across
Europe and North America were looking

1
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,259
for spectacular exhibits that would
attract visitors

1
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:16,029
elephants were an obvious choice the
first to appear were Asian elephants

1
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:22,839
they are found in India eastwards to
Southeast Asia and as far as the

1
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,818
visitors to the London Zoo in Victorian
times were concerned they were the

1
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:37,930
biggest animals they had ever seen but
African elephants are much bigger in

1
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,649
fact they are the largest living land
animals on the planet

1
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:47,730
and unlike Asian elephants they have
hardly ever been domesticated

1
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:58,250
they were once widespread across the
continent and records suggest the Jumbo

1
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:07,899
had been captured somewhere in the
Northeast a nineteenth-century traveller

1
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:13,730
exploring the Sudan has left an account
of the brutal way in which the local

1
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,279
people hunted elephants they would find
a mother and a calf chased them until

1
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,759
they were both exhausted and then spear
the mother for death and take the baby

1
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:32,139
so young Jambo almost certainly would
have witnessed the death of his mother

1
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:43,190
hunting is still a huge problem in
Africa adults are killed for their ivory

1
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,890
tusks and they often leave behind young
Wasson's motherless babies just like

1
00:09:48,889 --> 00:10:01,460
young jumbo as the first of his kind and
a British zoo jumbo was bound to attract

1
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,320
a lot of attention but his arrival
happened to coincide with a relatively

1
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,720
new technique called photography and
that would help to immortalize him

1
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:22,400
throughout this rich visual record of
Jumbo's life the image of one man occurs

1
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,750
again and again and again he was a man
whose life became totally bound up with

1
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:39,379
Jumbo's his name was Matthew Scott
Jumbo's keeper Scott was known to be a

1
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:46,669
difficult man with no close friends and
he was no expert on elephants but he did

1
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:54,679
have a deep empathy for animals of all
kinds within hours of meeting man and

1
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:00,289
beast had bonded and unusually for a
working man at the time Scott wrote an

1
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:08,120
account an autobiography of his life
with John Bell this is it there'd been

1
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,830
lots of books written about jumbo but
this is by far the most touching and

1
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:21,110
firsthand here's Scott describing his
first meeting with jumbo I thought I

1
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,169
never saw a creature so whoa be gone the
poor thing was full of disease which had

1
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:34,309
worked its way through the animals hide
and had almost eaten out its eyes Scott

1
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:40,939
now set out on his mission to raise the
young elephant it was the beginning of a

1
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,090
truly remarkable really
the Scot had never cared for a young

1
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:53,870
elephant before and it must have seemed
a daunting task the David Sheldrick

1
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:01,460
Wildlife Trust in Kenya knows exactly
how difficult it is head keeper Edwin

1
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:10,250
dos Ichi like Scott is caring for a new
orphan who has just arrived his elephant

1
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,330
close to me is called my Sierra he was
rescued from the Masai Mara

1
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,850
he was found stuck in the mud when he
was only about 2 month old and he seems

1
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,409
to have stayed there for quite some time
because he was very skinny very thin and

1
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:28,449
very weak a sign that he had been with
all the mother for quite some time and

1
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:40,700
we hope for the best for him Moo Sierra
is so traumatized by his experience a

1
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,330
keeper will have to stay by his side 24
hours a day

1
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,338
there's no quick easy fix when raising
orphaned elephants I mean you're in for

1
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,350
the long term so I'm arrived in
perfectly

1
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:05,089
good shape but the majority have had a
dramatic story before they get to us

1
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,360
the first step is straightforward
physical care but they need more than

1
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,539
that

1
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,629
elephants are highly social Monsieur ah
like jumbo needs what he would have

1
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:35,139
received from his elephant family
constant company touching and love they

1
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:39,189
need that emotional support
elephants are all about love and family

1
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,500
and that is what our orphans have been
robbed off and one has to very very

1
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,200
quickly plug that gap and it really is
the keepers at this early stage where

1
00:13:50,200 --> 00:14:00,879
that strong bond is formed matthew
scott's autobiography makes it clear

1
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:10,750
that he instinctively gave jumbo the
emotional support he needed i undertook

1
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:17,830
to be his doctor his nurse and general
servant i watched a nursed him nice and

1
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,920
day with all the care and affection of a
mother if it were possible for a man to

1
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,490
do such a thing

1
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,670
his approach clearly worked because six
months later john bell looked like a

1
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:41,679
different elephant and could at last be
displayed to the public by the time he

1
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,939
was six he was beginning to carry
children on rides around the zoo and

1
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,940
they apparently rewarded him with sticky
buns

1
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:56,980
lots of sticky buns jumbo quickly became
hugely popular even queen victoria's

1
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,899
children took rides on his back but had
this once wild african elephant

1
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:09,370
really grown into a gentle giant as
Sambo grew he was moved from his stable

1
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,889
next to the giraffe house into a larger
enclosure but London's zoos records from

1
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:20,620
the time tell us that behind the scenes
all was not well

1
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,899
young bears calmness during the day was
in sharp contrast to his behavior at

1
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:31,959
night then he will become possessed by
terrifyingly violent rages in which he

1
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,790
would smash the Timbers of his enclosure
and he did that so regularly the

1
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:40,899
carpenters would have to be called in
again in the game in order to make

1
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,659
repairs and he had a curious Jekyll and
Hyde character and one that would

1
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:50,579
persist during his time in London

1
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:57,399
remarkably Matthew Scott makes no real
mention of Jumbos rages but evidence for

1
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:06,000
these violent outbursts can be readily
seen in the photos of the time

1
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,800
male African elephants grow the longest
of all tusks yet in nearly every photo

1
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,859
Jumbo's tusks seem small or even
non-existent

1
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,850
the head of London Zoo at the time
Abraham Bartlett has left an account of

1
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:39,329
what happened to Jumbo's tusks during
these terrifying nocturnal rages jumbo

1
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:46,289
damage not only as enclosure but himself
on one such occasion is buttered records

1
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:53,578
in his book jumbo broke both his tusks
by driving them through the iron work of

1
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:59,429
his den the tusks were broken off within
his mouth probably close to his upper

1
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:03,438
jawbone and then when they did grow
again

1
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:08,899
jumbo ground them down against the
stonework

1
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,410
but what could be the cause of his
nighttime outbursts and terrible acts of

1
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,839
self-harm may be his bones back in New
York could contain some clues

1
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:27,559
I joined Richard and John as they
examine the most impressive part of

1
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:35,599
chompers remains his huge skull one of
the first things we see when we look at

1
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,199
his skull
it's just how malformed his teeth are

1
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,240
yeah yeah I mean we can see this tooth
here is really curved in this direction

1
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,279
and on the other side it's curved again
so it should have been straight yeah you

1
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,250
wouldn't expect to see the tooth bent in
this kind of way

1
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,390
in a normal healthy elephant we can
think of elephant teeth a bit like

1
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,950
conveyor belts so they have six teeth
but only ever one of them will be in

1
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,390
wear on each side at any one time and
another one will be coming in underneath

1
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:11,690
and behind it to replace it at the time
which that tooth falls out when that

1
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,590
tooth doesn't wear down enough what
happens is it gets stuck in the mouth

1
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:19,929
and it stays there but the other tooth
carries on developing and moving up

1
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:25,250
behind it and because it's softer
because it hasn't formed properly what

1
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,430
happens is it hits the tooth that's
impacted and bends bends out of shape

1
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,170
you can see right here that was a gap
all that sweet food and other

1
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,400
inappropriate diet that jumbo was having
could have gotten stuck and even gotten

1
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,630
into the root and the gum where
infection could have got started or at

1
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,540
least inflammation probably pretty
painful

1
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,879
okay so jumbo had terrible toothache
yeah I'm afraid so

1
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,390
poor thing

1
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:03,888
in the wild African elephants adapt
their diet to the changing seasons

1
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:10,288
during the wet season grass can make up
90% of what they eat but in drier months

1
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:16,710
they will browse on twigs and leaves and
even bark their Ridge - teeth help grind

1
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:25,200
down this more fibrous food making it
easier to digest but what a jumbo was

1
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:36,818
his diet in captivity really as poor as
his deformed teeth suggest

1
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,700
dr. Holly Miller from the University of
Nottingham may help answer that by

1
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,529
taking samples from Jumbo's bones
particularly the femur or leg bone and

1
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:58,500
the ribs she hopes to discover more
about his diet these tiny samples could

1
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,299
tell us a lot about the food jumper was
eating and reveal whether or not that

1
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,980
affected his overall health

1
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:19,269
jumbo has some interesting stories to
tell so his femur results that gives us

1
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:24,099
the diet abroad idea of the diet for
about 20 years and the ribs a lot

1
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:28,599
shorter period of that maybe ten five to
ten years so we're seeing his diet in

1
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:33,490
London and some of his diet in America
possibly and we're seeing largely a very

1
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,980
stable diet in that period does that
match with a suggestion that his diet

1
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,630
was actually almost entirely hay and
Penny buns yes we're definitely seeing

1
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,550
some suggestion that he's not getting
the variety of diet that other elephants

1
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,909
should what they should have in their
diet is a lot of browse

1
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,290
they use their trunks to access the top
of trees and they get twigs and bark

1
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:01,569
which helps them you know break down the
diet the pathologies we saw with his

1
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:06,669
teeth they are coming through in the
wrong angle and they were soft they're

1
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,730
not hardening because they're not being
used in the right way they're not being

1
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:17,319
used to grind down the right sort of
food so it seems that elephants just

1
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,759
like humans can suffer severe dental
problems if they don't have the right

1
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:31,690
diet but was this having an effect on
Jumbo's behavior anyone who's had

1
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:37,600
toothache knows that it seems worse at
night when you have no distractions so

1
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:45,089
maybe this is one of the explanations
for Jumbo's terrifying nocturnal rages

1
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:51,879
and maybe too it supports the story the
Matthew Scott is keeper used to feed him

1
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,400
lots of whiskey in order to calm him

1
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,788
Scot apparently had no family or close
friends and he totally devoted himself

1
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:07,798
to jumbo even to the extent that the two
of them would often drink late into the

1
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:15,720
night but Scott's unorthodox methods to
help pacify jumbo do little to calm his

1
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,009
boss's nerves
Abraham Bartlet worries that instead of

1
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:25,378
attacking his cage at night jumbo by day
might turn on the public including

1
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:37,308
children as a precaution he purchases a
gun in case he has to shoot jumbo

1
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:45,658
Bartlet becomes convinced the Jumbo is
suffering not from toothache but from

1
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,700
must a natural condition periodically
affecting young male elephants when they

1
00:22:50,700 --> 00:23:00,989
become sexually mature a Dueling must
testosterone levels in males can

1
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:06,960
increase sixty fold and they become
extremely aggressive the temporal glands

1
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,879
on the head behind the eyes swell and
leak and the elephants as they walk

1
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:19,980
discharge an almost continuous dribble
of urine creating a scent trail until

1
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:26,460
recently there was little research on
young male elephants dr. Vickie fish

1
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,629
lock is one of a team of researchers
who've been studying males in Kenya's

1
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:34,798
Amboseli National Park and she's now
beginning to understand what drives

1
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:40,980
their behavior was Abraham Bartlet write
about must being the cause of jumpers

1
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,579
aggression

1
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:55,470
so males in lost are really signaling
their competitive ability they're really

1
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,038
signaling that they're in great shape
and that females shouldn't meet with

1
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:05,849
them and other males should look out
must is really a way of saying I'm here

1
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:12,569
I'm big and I'm on a mission I usually
say they're cruising for girls and

1
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:21,210
trouble in the wild must usually starts
when a male elephant is in his mid to

1
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:28,110
late 20s but in captivity must can begin
much earlier and indeed jumbo was 21

1
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:35,839
when his nitrate is intensified could
his frightened aggression come from must

1
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:43,859
Vickie is not convinced must is really
for elephants a state about dominance

1
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,808
and establishing dominance
so if Jumbo's rages had been associated

1
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:53,609
with musk you would expect that would be
to direct it not just to his physical

1
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:58,558
surrounding but to his keepers as well
who were also controlling his behavior

1
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,138
in some way so you would expect him to
have directed some aggression towards

1
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:10,199
the humans around him but there is
nothing in the historical records to

1
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,798
suggest that jumper was ever violent
towards people so was Abraham Bart

1
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:25,200
mistaken for blaming Jumbo's increasing
aggression on must could there perhaps

1
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,700
be another explanation

1
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,890
work in the United States with retired
zoo and circus elephants may provide the

1
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:48,830
answer Sukie track here the behavioral
problems had afflicted Jambo more than a

1
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:53,809
hundred years ago are all too familiar
to carers who work with the African

1
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:58,990
elephants here in the elephant sanctuary
in Tennessee

1
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,599
the sanctuary is created to provide a
home for old or unwanted elephants

1
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:15,419
across America the elephants themselves
have been captured as orphans in Africa

1
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:22,220
and then kept isolated or locked up like
Jambo

1
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:28,970
when they first arrived here many are
extremely agitated and aggressive an

1
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,729
evidence of self-harm is all too obvious
their tusks worn down by repeated

1
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:48,139
rubbing against their den walls the
similarities the jambo are clear but

1
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:55,908
there is one big difference these
elephants are all female so clearly

1
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:04,099
they're ggressive nests cannot be due to
a surge of male hormones in fact their

1
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:08,749
behaviour quickly improves as they
settle in and build friendships with

1
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:16,368
other elephants in the sanctuary we now
know that elephants are extremely social

1
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:23,298
animals they need the company of their
own kind and we also know that they're

1
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:29,690
extremely intelligent they easily get
bored so keeping a single elephant in

1
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:36,920
captivity is not a way to rear a happy
and healthy elephant

1
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,460
to visitors to London Zoo in the 19th
century

1
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:46,250
Jambo did indeed appear to be a happy
elephant but they had no idea of his

1
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:53,690
aggressive darker side Bartlett kept
that a secret and back at the Museum in

1
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:59,180
New York there is evidence that his life
in captivity was also damaging his

1
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,590
physical health when we look at the knee
we see all sorts of kind of changes in

1
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:07,189
the bone we wouldn't really expect
seeing an elephant of his age remember

1
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,750
jumbo is only twenty four and still
growing but what we see actually when we

1
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,730
start looking at the bone surface we can
see it's really Ruffin and you'll see

1
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,630
these extra lumps of bone that shouldn't
be there we've got on this side and

1
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,310
John's got them on at the side of the
tibia yeah there's some bumps invading

1
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:30,079
into the joint surface itself which is
not a good sign and what these are is

1
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,549
these are lumps of bone at the point
where ligaments are attaching to the

1
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:38,389
joints and the bone is adapting to try
and compensate for all those stresses

1
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:43,070
he's experiencing for a 24 year old
elephant it's kind of like a 24 year old

1
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:48,799
person having similar kinds of joint
problems well we know jumbo carried

1
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,700
loads of people certainly children I
think even a doze could that have

1
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,269
produced this consequence
sure yeah loading them up with people

1
00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:00,470
and walking them around on a hard
surface and not giving them the right

1
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:06,350
diet all these factors could spiral
together and give jumbo problems like

1
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:11,929
these joint information problems so far
from being bad tempered with these

1
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:17,090
nocturnal rages sounds as though is
extraordinarily patient day after day

1
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:22,789
after day two to carry passengers which
is what the zoo did

1
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:28,159
there is no doubt that jumbo was held in
deep affection by the general public but

1
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,440
his bones suggest that he was in effect
being harmed by those who were toward

1
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,549
him most the stresses and strains of
captivity combined with a poor diet and

1
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:46,629
hundreds of rides at London Zoo created
symptoms usually associated with old age

1
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:53,080
his bones are more like an elephant in
its forties or fifties than in stretches

1
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:57,769
there's nothing in the zoo's records
suggesting that they had concerns about

1
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:04,430
Jumbo's health but the head of the zoo
Abraham Bartlett was still extremely

1
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:11,600
worried about Jumbo's fits of
uncontrollable violence as a result he

1
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:17,990
makes a shocking decision to try and
sell the popular elephant and he hears

1
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:25,069
of a possible buyer the famous American
circus showman PT Barnum news that

1
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:29,059
Barnum was looking for an African
elephant reach the London Zoo in the

1
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:33,379
form of a telegram which said what was
the lowest price that they would accept

1
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:39,290
for their African elephant here was a
marvelous opportunity for barter to get

1
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:46,220
rid of his problematic elephant and he
cabled back 2,000 pounds that's over a

1
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,569
hundred and fifty thousand pounds in
today's money an enormous sum and this

1
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:55,569
register shows that it was accepted

1
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:03,309
PT Barnum was the owner of the popular
greatest show on earth turning circus

1
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:08,710
which already featured 20 a chanel
offense he was an astute businessman who

1
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,210
had made his fortune exhibiting fake
curiosities and he wanted a star

1
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:22,690
attraction to draw in crowds to his new
circus Barnum sent his head elephant

1
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,890
keeper to collect jumbo and we know how
difficult a task that proved to be

1
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:37,900
because newspapers at the time reported
in detail on this highly public event as

1
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,390
crowds gathered he attached chains
around the elephant's neck jumbo ripped

1
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:48,580
them off they attached more change than
the venturi got him to the mouth of the

1
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:53,799
crate whereupon jumbo sensing a trap
simply lowered himself onto his stomach

1
00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:00,419
and sat there and nothing anybody could
do were make him budge

1
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,399
both Bartlett and Barnum began to
suspect that his keeper Scott was using

1
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,638
some form of secret language with Jambo
to make him unwilling to leave the zoo

1
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:16,058
could that be possible
good man an elephant have talked to each

1
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:23,829
other today we know that elephants use a
variety of ways to communicate but it's

1
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:29,259
taken decades of field research to
decode the many sounds and signals that

1
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:40,868
they use despite having poor eyesight
elephants will use visual signals to

1
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:47,109
communicate when near each other their
ears trunks and tails can all be used to

1
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:56,168
indicate emotional moods come on okay Oh
in recent years scientists have come to

1
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:00,909
discover that elephants are even able to
understand the gesture that we tend to

1
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:07,570
think of is uniquely human pointing not
only that it's been shown that they can

1
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:13,418
distinguish between different human
voices so was Matthew Scott secretly

1
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:21,009
telling jumbo to stay put I'm absolutely
sure that in a situation where you have

1
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:25,450
a one-on-one relationship like jumbo had
with his keeper the trust that gets

1
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:32,200
built up enables two-way communication
and what happens next

1
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:38,200
seems to support this Barnum offered to
take on Scott as jumpers keeper to go

1
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,730
with his beloved elephant to America and
almost immediately after this deal is

1
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:48,339
agreed Jambo cooperated

1
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:55,509
as the frenzy about Jumbo's departure
reaches its peak 20,000 people a day

1
00:33:55,509 --> 00:34:02,470
assembled at the zoo to protest about it
a court case was filed to try and

1
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:09,220
prevent the bargain Queen Victoria was
said to be extremely upset but the deal

1
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:17,529
had been done on the 22nd of March 1882
in the middle of the night crowds of

1
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:23,440
onlookers assembled to watch jumbo being
pulled to the docks by 12 horses with

1
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,639
Scott standing stroking his elephant's
trunk in reassurance

1
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:44,470
jumbo arrived at 5 o'clock in the
morning down here some Katharine's dock

1
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:49,879
he was loaded onto a barge and then
taken out to the assyrian monarch the

1
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,840
british ship that was going to take him
across the atlantic he drank some beer

1
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,190
followed by a whiskey chaser and then
the world's most famous elephant was

1
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:06,950
ready for his departure as the ship
slowly sailed down the Thames thousands

00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:15,139
lined its banks to wish him well the
publicity surrounding his departure had

1
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:19,909
not gone unnoticed on the other side of
the Atlantic and would ensure that a

1
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:24,579
huge crowd would be waiting to receive
him

1
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:34,838
it was a two-week journey across the
ocean to New York City and it must have

1
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:40,119
been a horrible trip for the animal it
seems that at times he was a little

1
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:46,599
seasick and had to be kept calm with
alcohol but over in America jumbo mania

1
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,940
was already erupting and his new owner
PT Barnum was keen to fuel this

1
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:59,889
excitement when the Assyrian Manik
reached the Hudson River

1
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:05,019
Barnum chartered a small boat to take
him out to the ship so that he could see

1
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:12,030
his purchase for the very first time was
it really as big as he had hoped

1
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:18,339
Barnum declared without hesitation that
this was the biggest African elephant in

1
00:36:18,338 --> 00:36:23,279
the world whether that was true or not

1
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:33,869
to discover how a big jumbo really was
we can turn to his bones again the team

1
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:42,960
will use his leg bone as a starting
point so one of the things we can do is

1
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,159
we can take the femur so we can take the
like this brush this boat yeah and we

1
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:51,509
can measure the length because this is
the bone that is the longest bone in the

1
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,860
elephant's body and it gives us a good
indication of how tall jumbo might have

1
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:01,730
been so how long was it 107 centimeters

1
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:12,509
circumference is 39 centimeters we can
estimate his weight at around 6,000

1
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:21,990
kilograms that's not jumbo is measuring
in 3.2 meters tall and we know how old

1
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,469
he was and we know how old he is and
that's really really important we know

1
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:31,859
he's 24 at the time of his death what we
can establish is what a normal wild

1
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,130
African elephant
should be at shoulder height at that age

1
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:44,130
and that would be about 2.7 meters so
3.2 meters actually that's 20 percent

1
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,289
different doesn't it almost different
you have a jumbo was was taller than he

1
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:53,550
should be for his age
wow that's surprised jumbo is about 20

1
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,840
percent taller yeah 3.2 meters is what
he really was at the shoulder and

1
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,940
instead what he should have been for a
wild African elephant at 24 years of age

1
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:11,400
would be more like 2.7 yeah so he's he's
a leggy elephant firs age so Jumbo's

1
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:18,470
height was around 10 feet 6 inches or
3.2 meters at the time of his death

1
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:24,449
evidence from wild elephants suggests
that they can reach up to 13 feet or 4

1
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:30,439
meters in height and will weigh almost
7,000 kilograms

1
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:39,329
but his leg bone tells us more this
zigzag line here this crack tells us I

1
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:45,659
assumed that he was still going yes
absolutely right so the ends of the bone

1
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:49,889
are separate from the main body of the
bone when mammals are growing and

1
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:54,239
eventually they will unite when the
animal reaches its full size but we can

1
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,779
see here because this crack is still
open we can see that jumbo is still

1
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,800
growing male African elephants continue
to grow until they're 40

1
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,880
so jumbo had another 16 years of growing
so although he wasn't quite as tall as

1
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,570
Barnum said he was this animal had the
potential of being exceptionally big he

1
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:21,769
could have been a record breaker if he
had had that 16 extra years to grow

1
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:28,980
Jumbo's leg shows us that he was indeed
a very big elephant in fact he was

1
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,920
bigger than you would expect for an
elephant of his age he wasn't as big as

1
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,010
Barnum claimed but he was still growing
and he could have actually matched that

1
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,670
claim had he lived

1
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:53,490
but then as jumbo tours North America
with the circus there is a major change

1
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,539
with 20 other elephants to keep him
company

1
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:03,489
jumbo has a lot more stimulation and
there are no accounts of the night rages

1
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:10,149
he suffered in London and of course
Matthew Scott his keeper from London Zoo

1
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:23,889
is by his side throughout but what about
Jumbo's health at this time the research

1
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:30,629
team has another fine to show me a
rather gruesome piece of Jumbo's remains

1
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:41,649
so this rather extraordinary relic is
actually Jumbo's tail it's actually a

1
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:46,990
really key part of the Jumbo puzzle from
Tufts University in Massachusetts where

1
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:52,509
they held jumbo stuffed body after he
died but unfortunately that was lost in

1
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:58,900
a fire but we still have the remarkable
tale and what we have is these hairs

1
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:05,019
some very thick and some very thin the
thinner ones are new growth we can take

1
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:11,048
some samples of these finer hairs and
one of the thicker longer growing hairs

1
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:17,019
so we get a nice snapshot of Jumbo's
diet almost right before he died who

1
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:22,449
would have thought it well Holly
analyzes the chemical content of Jumbo's

1
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:28,739
tail Richard and John discovers
something unusual about Jumbo's hip bone

1
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:33,818
it's both sides and it's also the same
layering effects you've got the sort of

1
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:37,889
older remodeled bone underneath and
you've got this layer of active new bone

1
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:44,900
forming on top really really very
pronounced a lot of information

1
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:50,369
he's got so many signs of stress and
strain related injuries there must've

1
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:53,339
been incredibly painful for him but may
have reflected that there used to which

1
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:00,600
he was put both in London and in a
circus in America could these science of

1
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:08,009
information indicate the Jumbos health
was in serious decline Holly has now had

1
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,420
time to look at the chemical clues in
the hair samples from Jumbo's tail and

1
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,610
of particular interest is the amount of
nitrogen an element that's crucial to

1
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,930
the repair of the body

1
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:26,399
Jumbo's nitrogen values are odd when
compared to other elephants in other

1
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,410
circumstances and we can see that jumbo
is the highest of all these here our

1
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:37,230
line is by quite a long way yes
so elephants can reach these levels when

1
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,490
they're stressed but it only happened
seasonally when they're not getting much

1
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:44,939
from their diet you see stress that
doesn't mean the stress on the body

1
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,110
means something to do with the diet
physiologically stress their bodies

1
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:52,710
aren't getting necessarily what they
need from their environment and if we

1
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,250
think about what we saw where he was
laying down all that new bone in his

1
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:01,829
pelvis to create new bone in your body
you need an awful lot of protein so he

1
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,440
would have been taking all of that from
his diet

1
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,590
he's also we think at the end probably
quite sick we have some written records

1
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:15,059
that suggests that he was unwell towards
the end with some sort of wasting

1
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:20,179
disease potentially
Jumbo's body must have been trying

1
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:25,879
desperately to extract as much nitrogen
as it could from his diet to help repair

1
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:32,780
the bone in his hip these injuries were
likely related to his treatment in

1
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:40,310
captivity and it seems that as a result
jumbo was losing weight there is little

1
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:47,119
doubt that he must have been suffering
but that didn't stop his American owner

1
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,319
PT Barnum from finding new ways to
promote his biggest elephant and a

1
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,269
remarkable opportunity soon arose

1
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:07,469
the Brooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest
suspension bridges in the United States

1
00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:14,368
it was in fact opened in 1883 the year
after jumbo arrived in America and

1
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:24,750
almost immediately an accident on it led
to the death of 12 people so to squash

1
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,119
any rumors about the bridges safety the
authorities agreed to an unusual

1
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,170
publicity stunt

1
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:47,889
on the 17th of May 1884 thousands of
people lined these banks to see 20

1
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:53,079
elephants led by John Doe
marching across the bridge what a sight

1
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,569
it must have been scotch
Jumbo's Kiefer was nervous about the

1
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:04,510
whole event this is what he writes about
it when jumbo put his foot down on the

1
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:11,380
bridge the bridge rebounded after the
shock given by his foot the rebound was

1
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,849
made by his second footstep and there
was a great vibration caused by it

1
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:23,279
I assure my reader that I was thankful
when we arrived on the bottle inside

1
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:34,710
although jumbo goes back to touring with
the rest of the circus all is not well

1
00:45:36,389 --> 00:45:42,849
it seems the bone damage to jumpers leg
is becoming a problem in his day-to-day

1
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:50,259
life not long after the parade across
Brooklyn Bridge an associate of Barnum's

1
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:58,120
reports in a letter than an ailing jumbo
could no longer lie down that doesn't

1
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:01,869
stop Barnum who's keen to keep the
circus traveling with his prized

1
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:04,469
elephant

1
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,310
in September 1885 the circus train
crosses the border into Canada on what

1
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:20,840
should be a routine tour

1
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,190
I'm keen to follow their journey
because the accounts of what happened

1
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:45,440
next are shocking and tragic in the
1880s st. Thomas Ontario is the perfect

1
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,409
stop for Barnum & Bailey Circus it's the
central hub for 26 different railways

1
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:59,239
that converged here from all over North
America on the day when the circus comes

1
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:05,419
to town jumbo is once again the main
attraction drawing crowds from miles

1
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,840
around

1
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:14,539
by the late evening the show is over the
tents are being taken down the

1
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:19,300
performers are packing up and the
animals are being led down to the Train

1
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:25,220
jumbo and a small elephant called Tom
Thumb are the last to be loaded and as

1
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:32,089
Matthew Scott leads them towards their
boxcar a freight train comes thundering

1
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:37,700
down the track towards them reports of
what happens next

1
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:43,549
differ some eyewitness accounts record
jumbo running away from the Train

1
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:51,530
but soon after Barnum claims the
opposite he declares Jumbo's death a

1
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:57,230
great heroic act telling reporters that
the large elephant had run headfirst

1
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:03,199
into the Train sacrificing his own life
to save his keeper and Tom Thumb the

1
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:11,359
smaller elephant this image based on
Barnum's account of Jumbo's head-on

1
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:16,420
crash was to be published again and
again

1
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:25,860
so what is the truth what actually
happened on that railroad in San Thomas

1
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:36,220
the research team has been looking over
Jumbo's bones for signs of injury now

1
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:41,769
that you've seen the entire skeleton is
there anything we can deduce about the

1
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:45,820
way in which he met his end is there our
first thought was we might find some

1
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,680
evidence of trauma in a skeleton that
might relate to the impact of the train

1
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:55,599
accident so we've looked at the skeleton
for evidence of fractures and we have

1
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,460
found no signs of any bone fractures
that are affected either his skull or

1
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:11,019
his pelvis amazing so the exact details
of jumpers death are still rather

1
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:17,590
puzzling while the rest of the world may
have forgotten Jumbos story in the town

1
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:23,890
where he died it's a proud part of their
history the elgin county museum is

1
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:29,529
almost a shrine to Jumbos memory and I'm
hoping it's curator Mike Baker will have

1
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:35,590
some clues to help explain exactly how
jumbo died this group of things that

1
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,610
were found in his stomach while the skin
and the bones are being prepared for

1
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,930
mounting there's a little miniature Pig
at the back which is actually a match

1
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:49,869
safe a charm bracelet a button a collar
stud and a tooth I don't want to think

1
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:54,369
about how he got a tooth but they're all
part of the many many things they found

1
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:59,349
in jumbled stomach including quite a few
coins clenched yes maybe as many as 300

1
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:04,150
mostly pennies pennies that I think were
supposed to have gone to Scott this

1
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:08,789
payment for a ride and then not quite
making it to Scott

1
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:12,880
jumbo would have grabbed him with his
trunk because I think it was a bit of a

1
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,130
kleptomaniac with that trunk and these
what are these well these appear to be

1
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:22,180
photographs of the locomotive that
collided with him the very one that

1
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:25,989
brought about his death yeah not too
many years later and the most

1
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,529
interesting feature is the little tin
elephant

1
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:34,570
that someone has cut out say yes this is
the locomotive that got jumbled yeah I'm

1
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:43,269
so sure why they're proud of that but
they were keen to market anyway among

1
00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:55,458
all this memorabilia is a photograph
taken just after Jumbo's death

1
00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:00,090
this is a much enlarged version of the
photo that you often see a poor dead

1
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:06,360
jumble it's taken about a day after the
accident it's Scott at his head and one

1
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,289
of the owners of the circus Hutchison
lying against them and it's interesting

1
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:14,690
to see in this photograph now that's
blowing up you can see a series of

1
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:20,550
abrasions on his height and it matches
up very nicely with the one good graphic

1
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:27,330
from soon after the collision mike has
come across an image of jumbo that I've

1
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:32,699
not seen before it was discovered in an
antique print gallery in Washington and

1
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:42,210
is now on loan to the museum and it is
the final piece of the Jumbo jigsaw it's

1
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:47,280
probably the best depiction of the
actual collision with jumbo this was

1
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,780
done by an artist possibly on the site
about three days after the collision it

1
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,410
matches very nicely with the
photographic evidence and you can see

1
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:59,819
the engine coming up behind jumbo so
causing the abrasions that you can see

1
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:04,890
in the enlarged photograph it's the same
point of contact so here is Matthew

1
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:10,559
Scott having failed to signal to the
locomotive that is the circus train with

1
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,289
the boxcar the Jumbo was going to get
into and the locomotive was outrun him

1
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:22,110
and hit him in the rear and that's the
end of poor jumbo exactly not what

1
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:27,599
Barnum said no not at all
so Barnum saw was a complete invention

1
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,539
pure Buncombe as as he would probably
say

1
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:40,739
with no evidence of fractures on Jumbo's
bones it seems the most likely cause of

1
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:46,259
death was internal bleeding so it's
unlikely that jumbo died instantly

1
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:53,180
giving Scott time to say goodbye to his
much-loved elephant

1
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:07,759
eyewitness accounts report that Scott
rushed to Jumbo's side and watched as he

1
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:15,430
took one last breath and died his
devoted keeper is said to have wept

1
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:21,859
inconsolably at the loss of his best
friend Matthew Scott never really

1
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:27,500
recovered from the death of his beloved
elephant he hung around the surface for

1
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:32,510
some time and then Barnum in a
businesslike and brisk way paid him off

1
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:45,890
and had Jumbo's body stuffed and mounted
and paraded jumbo was just 24 when he

1
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,000
died

1
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:55,750
his death became front-page news around
the world

1
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:00,980
the young elephant who had arrived at
London's sewers and orphan had become a

1
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:06,280
hugely popular and much-loved superstar

1
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:13,429
he gave a great number of people
enormous pleasure and a vivid

1
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:18,139
unforgettable impression of the
magnificence of the natural world that

1
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:25,309
lay far beyond European cities but we
now know that the life he led was not

1
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:35,088
the right life for an elephants keeping
elephants locked up on their own goes

1
00:54:35,088 --> 00:54:41,809
against everything that they've evolved
to be not having any choice not having

1
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:47,690
anything different would be really
detrimental to their well-being just

1
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:51,250
like it's bad for people

1
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,940
in the case of jumbo I didn't think
there's anything worse than

1
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:09,139
incarceration announcement a really
really tragic life lost

1
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:21,570
maybe it's remarkable he survived as
long as he did in the conditions that

1
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,420
elephants were kept in at the time
because no one really knew how to care

1
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:29,369
for an African elephant there were still
mysterious exotic animals from deepest

1
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:41,759
darkest Africa we do have the choice of
how we take care of elephants wherever

1
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,870
they are and jumbo is a good case of
where we did not take good care of an

1
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:49,429
elephant and we can learn from that

1
00:55:55,989 --> 00:56:02,679
thankfully we now have a much deeper
understanding of the needs of elephants

1
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:07,338
we've come to realize that they should
always be in the company of their own

1
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:14,088
kind so that they can build lasting
relationships and they need space to

1
00:56:14,088 --> 00:56:20,858
live their lives but many held in
captivity today do not have that space

1
00:56:20,858 --> 00:56:26,920
one hundred and thirty years after jumbo
was killed there's good news

1
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,710
circuses across Europe and America are
sending their performing elephants into

1
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:37,909
retirement
of course the elephants can't be

1
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:42,108
returned to the wild they were captured
too young to have learnt the skills

1
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:49,038
necessary to survive out there but
thankfully there are sanctuaries like

1
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:52,329
this one in Tennessee

1
00:56:55,329 --> 00:57:01,179
here there are great areas of woodland
where the elephant can roam and do what

1
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:06,419
they want to do and not what human
beings tell them to do

1
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:19,389
young bears life was cut cruelly short
but these elephants will have a chance

1
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:25,049
of having a long and peaceful end to
theirs

1
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:40,740
forget all the cold and snow here today
and savor an exotic adventure in Havana

1
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:55,919

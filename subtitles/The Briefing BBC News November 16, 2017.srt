1
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,849
zimbabwe's military is in full control of
the country.

1
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,379
robert mugabe, president for nearly a0 years,
remains under house arrest.

1
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,769
climate change is inevitable, even if we drastically
cut co2 emissions.

1
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,250
a new environmental report makes grim reading.

1
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,420
selling for $400 million, that is the better,
and this is sold! -- thatis the better, and

1
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,769
this is sold! -- that is the bid.

1
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:42,338
the world's most expensive artwork.

1
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:51,250
a long-lost painting by leonardo da vinci
sells at auction for $400 million.

1
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:58,719
the soaring cost of living in zimbabwe - could
the dark days of hyperinflation be returning?

1
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,569
plus africa's richest woman, the boss of angola's
state oil company, is sacked - so what now

1
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:24,759
for isabel dos santos? a very warm welcome
to the

1
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,359
programme, briefing you on all you need to
know in global news, business and sport. and

1
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,780
you can be part of the conversation today.

1
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:41,319
we are asking for your reaction to the da
vinci frenzy - the 500-year-old painting sold

1
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,060
for $400 million, smashing all records.

1
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,960
are you amazed or appalled? is it worth it
or wealth gone mad?

1
00:01:49,959 --> 00:02:03,000
your comments to hashtag #bbcthebriefing.

1
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,519
we start the programme in zimbabwe.

1
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,169
south africa's defence and state security
ministers have arrived in the country, and

1
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,128
they now hope to hold talks with president
mugabe and army leaders, following the military’s

1
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:16,789
seizure of power.

1
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:22,299
mr mugabe remains under house arrest, although
the military says he is safe.

1
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,370
it denies staging a coup, instead claiming
to be acting against "criminals" surrounding

1
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,730
the president.

1
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:34,789
the african union has demanded an immediate
return to constitutional order.

1
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:38,530
0ur correspondent anne soy joins me now from
zimbabwe.

1
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,400
we've heard that there's a calm but tense
atmosphere on the streets of zimbabwe's capital,

1
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
harare.

1
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,450
it is hard to know what will happen next.

1
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,359
that is right.

1
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,420
you get the sense that the military is controlled
listening to the media here.

1
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:59,059
many of the story is talking about them, the
youth league, or the ruling party, zanu-pf,

1
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,759
pledging allegiance to the burko.

1
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:09,439
not much mention of robert mugabe, except
for the move by the military, in their words,

1
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,199
to deal with criminals around

1
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,530
the president.

1
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:26,209
grace mugabe, his wife, her whereabouts is
unknown, along with that of the former vice

1
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,299
president, emmerson mnangagwa.

1
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,469
you mentioned both grace mugabe and the vice
president, both of whom we don't know where

1
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:38,659
they are, butjust august through the politicking
that led to this disaster.

1
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:46,759
it is clear now that it has a split between
the ruling zanu-pf that has brought zimbabwe

1
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,908
to the current situation where the president,
rod mcgarvie, even though the military says

1
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,389
he remains in charge, remains under house
arrest.

1
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:03,979
his wife, grace mugabe, as being ambitious,
very keen to succeed him, and last week, the

1
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:11,068
vice president, emmerson mnangagwa, was sacked,
and he fled out of the country as a result

1
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,068
of that.

1
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:17,639
but he also vowed to come back, and make sure
that he takes

1
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,329
control of the country.

1
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:26,300
we still do not know where he is, but what
is clear now is that the army chief, constantino

1
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,730
chiwenga, is with him.

1
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,700
thank you for at that.

1
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,909
all the latest is on a website.

1
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,010
-- our website.

1
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:47,849
that's bbc.com/news.

1
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,060
but now, let's look at a study which suggests
many impacts of climate change are already

1
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,329
inevitable, even if the world radically cuts
carbon dioxide emissions immediately.

1
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:04,899
an international research programme called
helix says that sea level rises of at least

1
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:05,899
several

1
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,439
tens of centimetres will "definitely happen".

1
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,719
andy moore reports.

1
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,210
this latest report has been presented to an
international conference on climate change

1
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:20,519
in bonn, where world leaders have already
begun to gather.

1
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,629
whatever they can do to restrict carbon, dockside
restriction -- restrict carbon dioxide restriction,

1
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:37,000
climate change cannot be avoided.

1
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,490
researchers can say with some confidence that
half a million people in low-lying bangladesh

1
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,560
will be affected by rising sea levels.

1
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,250
in a worst-case scenario, with rising emissions,
africa could reach 12 million by the end of

1
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,129
the century.

1
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,990
some tropical areas already suffer levels
of heat bringing a very high risk of human

1
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,639
harm, so-called heat stress.

1
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,219
the researchers say that with two degrees
warming, large areas of the subcontinent and

1
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,580
africa would get these conditions.

1
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:15,440
rainfall and river levels are hard to predict,
but scientists say they are

1
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,849
confident they will be increased flooding
on some major rivers, even if emissions are

1
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,320
strictly reduced.

1
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,209
and there is no sign of that happening at
the moment.

1
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:28,359
the conference has already been told that
global emissions of carbon dioxide, continue

1
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
to rise.

1
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,520
-- dioxide, continue to rise.

1
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,959
-- dioxide continue to rise.

1
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,839
a lot of thatis dioxide continue to rise.

1
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:41,619
a lot of that is being attributed to the chinese
economy.

1
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,680
let's brief you on some of the other stories
making the news.

1
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,900
the greek prime minister, alexis tsipras,
has announced a state of national mourning

1
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:54,129
for those who died in flash flooding that's
killed at least 15 people near athens. local

1
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,699
officials say the floods, which brought torrents
of reddish mud flowing through three towns,

1
00:06:58,699 --> 00:06:59,699
are unprecedented.

1
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,990
homes have been inundated and roads destroyed.

1
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,639
russian officials say a new law which will
categorise overseas media outlets as "foreign

1
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,870
agents" could affect the us government broadcaster
voice of america.

1
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,810
russia's lower house of parliament backed
the measure, which was drawn up after washington

1
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,740
ordered the russian state tv channel, rt,
to register

1
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,329
as a foreign agent.

1
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:28,769
astronomers say they've discovered a planet
about the size of earth, with a mild climate

1
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,180
which could harbour life.

1
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,370
called ross 128b, it's a mere 11 light years
away.

1
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,430
researchers believe the planet's temperature
could range from -60 to 20 celsius, making

1
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,939
it a promising place to search for life beyond
earth.

1
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:51,100
are they out there?

1
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,439
life, is it out there, that is what i mean.

1
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,769
a 500-year-old painting of christ by leonardo
da vinci has been sold in new york for a record

1
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,120
price of $400 million.

1
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,060
after eighteen minutes of frenzied bidding,
this was the moment the hammer went down on

1
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,689
the artwork, which is known as salvator mundi,
or saviour of the world.

1
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:18,269
we moved to the alarm of da vinci,

1
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,810
the salvator mundi... we moved to the alarm
of da vinci, the salvator mundi.

1
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:28,370
.. christie suggested that salvator mundi
would sell for about Â£76 million.

1
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,709
they knew that was likely to be exceeded co
nsta ntly. knew that was likely to be exceeded

1
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:32,710
constantly.

1
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,700
nobody could get how come the way.

1
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,200
dating from around 1506, the image ofjesus
christ is thought to have been created for

1
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,919
the french royal family.

1
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:48,328
disastrously restored in 1958, it was auctioned
in luck than for a mere Â£45. -- in london.

1
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:56,679
at that time, most experts thought was based
on and leonardo, not by the man himself.

1
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,748
last night, the tension was obvious.

1
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:06,170
$100 million was reached quickly, than $200
million.

1
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,169
$190 million is dead.

1
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,169
$200 million.

1
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,169
$190 million is dead.

1
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,169
$200 million.

1
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,169
$190 million is dead.

1
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,169
$200 million is dead.

1
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:16,769
that broke the previous record, held by picasso's

1
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,549
women of algiers.

1
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:22,809
i am selling at $240 million.

1
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,028
can you give me $290 million alex i thought
so.

1
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:30,429
the -- trended million dollars.

1
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:33,789
-- trended million dollars.

1
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:39,198
the buyer on the phone was tempted to the
extraordinary final amount.

1
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:46,358
the 100 million dollars as the bid, and the
pieces sold.

1
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,359
-- $300 million.

1
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:53,660
the sale chose the importance of rarity. this
could be the last leonardo to average auction,

1
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:59,269
and was half a millennium after his death,
he assured us of the greatest star in the

1
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:04,169
art world.

1
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,229
so we asked you what you think of this.

1
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,120
a report? are you amazed ? what you think
of this.

1
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,940
a report? are you amazed? is this just a normal
sort of process in terms of fine art, the

1
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
fact that it is so

1
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,050
rare... tyrrell paul is getting in touch with
us from the united states and he has said

1
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:25,859
that it is more than many countries are worth.

1
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,120
that is in the same number in his opinion.

1
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,068
-- tall paul. jon says he does not believe
you.

1
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:42,519
somebody else has said whether bitcoin is
worth $7,000 or something to bet, it is to

1
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,999
be believed.

1
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:51,580
and facebook is more valuable than general
electric and exxon mobil, so this is the way

1
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,600
that things are going.

1
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,409
then others to say they have been better.

1
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:57,828
that was once you from me.

1
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:01,259
many of you are just saying that you are appalled.

1
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:07,149
then we have somebody saying that they don't
know about it, but it is the same model as

1
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,139
the mona lisa, said many comments coming in
from you.

1
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,308
coming up on business briefing, we'll be looking
at the economic

1
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:21,669
backdrop to the events in zimbabwe - amid
reports of soaring inflation despite the official

1
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:22,669
figures.

1
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:27,958
and another big story in africa, the continent's
richest woman has been sacked from herjob.

1
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,629
the president of angola, joao lourenco, has
fired the head of the country's state oil

1
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,490
company sonangol.

1
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:41,139
isabel dos santos is the billionaire daughter
of former presidentjose eduardo dos santos,

1
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:45,810
and africa's richest woman, with a net worth
of over $3 billion.

1
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:53,049
president lourenco, known asjlo, has promised
to tackle corruption.

1
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,878
amrita sen is here from energy aspects.

1
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:02,459
this is quite an interesting story, isn't
it? we apple was arrested zimbabwe, and this

1
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:08,649
is another key african economy, and this will
have big economic applications.

1
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:09,649
usually.

1
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,879
she took over a while ago, and there

1
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:22,339
was criticism of possible nepotism.

1
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,480
the father has obviously ruled the country
for 38 years.

1
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,829
but the oil community was quite positive about
her, because she has been a businesswoman.

1
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:32,179
sonangol has been struggling.

1
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:36,370
they had been deteriorating the finance and
the oil prices crash.

1
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,820
she was supposed to restructure the company
and turn it around, but then, of course, when

1
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:50,070
she got into power, projects started slipping,
and she said it could take five years to restructure.

1
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:56,360
in the meantime, what is this mean for the
energy sector? within angola, this political

1
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:03,449
wrangling, this is the world's biggest oil
company, isn't it? actually have a lot of

1
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,109
problems with the finances.

1
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,289
and angola has really suffered.

1
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:10,669
they have had a lot of new projects come online,
but diplomats have been declining so quickly

1
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:12,828
that production has not been going anywhere.

1
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:14,458
so this is an

1
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,278
attempt to fast forward some of the reforms
that need to happen.

1
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:23,149
whether it happens or not is a separate thing,
but that is the attempt right now, very much.

1
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,549
0k, thank you very a much indeed.

1
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:30,409
and amrita will be back soon with us for the
new -- news briefing.

1
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:36,828
please keep the discussion going in regards
to the painting.

1
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:44,289
still to come this morning, roger federer
is through to the last four at the atp finals

1
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:49,318
in london, beating alexander zverez, his junior
by 16 yea rs. alexander zverez, his junior

1
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:50,318
by 16 years.

1
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:57,419
that and more in the sports briefing.

1
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:05,039
berliners from both east and west linked hands
and danced round their liberated territory.

1
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,938
and, with nobody to stop them, it wasn't long
before the first attempts were made to destroy

1
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:12,049
the structure itself.

1
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:16,628
it's keeping the candidate's name always in
the public eye that counts.

1
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:22,409
success or failure depends not only on public
display but on the local campaign headquarters

1
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,860
and the heavy routine work

1
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,180
of their women volunteers.

1
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,759
yasser arafat, who dominated the palestinian
cause for so long, has died.

1
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,639
the palestinian authority has declared a state
of mourning for the leader who symbolised

1
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,869
his people's hopes for independent statehood.
in the wake of the colombian volcano disaster,

1
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:44,480
rescue teams are trying to reach thousands
of survivors who managed to clamber onto rooftops

1
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,420
and trees above the sea of mud. after 17 years
of discussion, the result was greeted with

1
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:51,789
an outburst ofjoy.

1
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:56,629
women ministers who'd long felt only grudgingly
accepted amongst the ranks of clergy suddenly

1
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,688
felt welcomed.

1
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:07,708
you're watching the briefing.

1
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:13,018
0ur headlines: a new report is warning that
climate change is inevitable even if we drastically

1
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,839
cut co2 emissions.

1
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,589
zimbabwe's military is in full control of
the country.

1
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,890
robert mugabe - president for nearly 40 years
-

1
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,178
remains under house arrest.

1
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:31,208
let's stay with that now: laura westbrook
has this report.

1
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,618
what would have been unthinkable only a few
weeks ago has happened: robert mugabe, the

1
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:44,339
world's oldest leader, has lost control of
the country he has ruled for 37 years.

1
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,930
the military denied staging a coup, but it
is clear that robert mugabe is no longer calling

1
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,789
the shots.

1
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:54,740
zimbabwe's ruling party, the zanu-pf, are
emphatic.

1
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,329
president mugabe is still in power.

1
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:00,318
he's the man in charge of zimbabwe, officially,
right now.

1
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:03,759
a lot has happened.

1
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,379
but what has happened is a not coup.

1
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:11,930
the language is important, and key regional
block, the african union, has given its full

1
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,308
support to the country's legal situations.

1
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,730
to the country's legal institutions.

1
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,720
translation: the military has assured asked
that this is not a coup d'etat. the african

1
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,379
union is against any unconstitutional change
of government.

1
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,600
the president still has his supporters, especially
in rural areas.

1
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,970
but in the capital, harare, news of his house
arrest has been welcomed.

1
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,950
translation: i want to thank the generalfor
removing this tyrant. he was ruling this country

1
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,769
like it belongs to his family.

1
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:53,100
this boils down to an internal power struggle
within the governing zanu-pf. 0n the one side,

1
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:59,550
this man, emmerson mnangagwa, who was fired
last week from his position as vice president.

1
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:05,279
0n the other, mugabe's wife, grace mugabe,
known as "gucci grace" for her at extravagant

1
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,549
spending, and one of the most powerful politicians
in the country.

1
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:16,720
it is believed that her being groomed to succeed
robert mugabe is what sparked the takeover.

1
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,870
the military has begun to arrest those close
to her.

1
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,679
there has to be a transition away

1
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:29,170
from robert mugabe but it has to be through
a process that makes the government credible.

1
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:35,130
zimbabwe is waking up to a country that has
changed dramatically.

1
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,870
but whether it is the change they had been
hoping for is far from clear.

1
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,538
laura westbrook, bbc news.

1
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:50,140
50,000 children are expected to die in yemen
this year according to the charity save the

1
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
children.

1
00:17:51,140 --> 00:18:02,120
who's the rebels -- houthi.

1
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,768
the coalition tried to restore the government.

1
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:12,500
in the second of his special report, clive
myrie has been to the frontline were fierce

1
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,569
fighting is continuing.

1
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,579
the city sums up the dystopian

1
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:28,168
nightmare.

1
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,399
no one seems to be in control here.

1
00:18:30,398 --> 00:18:32,229
rubbish piles up in the street.

1
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:42,519
it feels the local can now instead of water,
much of it a cts now instead of water, much

1
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,970
of it acts of human excrement.

1
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,250
colorado is rampant.

1
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,250
-- cholera.

1
00:18:50,250 --> 00:19:01,308
0n the main highway, running north to south,
is the southern battlefield.

1
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:05,849
neither side is making any significant territorial
game.

1
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:11,699
the fighting simply grinds on with civilians
in ever to be caught in the middle.

1
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,069
for the saudi let coalition, air power

1
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:19,269
has not proved decisive and is not winning
the day.

1
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,880
their military intervention has become stuck,
it is bogged down.

1
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,780
any kind of victory seems a long way.

1
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:31,589
few in yemen have the luxury of memory that
do not include a time of war.

1
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:38,649
through britain's colonial era, communism,
civil war and now the proxy struggle of regional

1
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,429
powers that see saudi arabia so prominent
here.

1
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:49,080
this is what is left of a department store,
smashed by an air strike.

1
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,099
after all the destruction and lies loss, this
warlike most modern conflicts will only come

1
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:59,480
to an end with a political solution and, at
the very least that requires the yemeni themselves

1
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,450
to come togetherfor requires the yemeni themselves
to come together for the greater good but

1
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,360
the chances of that happening are as remote
as they have ever been so it seems yemen's

1
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,178
pain is destined to endure.

1
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,250
all the malnourished

1
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,269
children are victims of grand designs.

1
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:26,120
the manoeuvrings of the middle east to a place
from tehran to ridyard.

1
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,428
yemen is stuck in the middle.

1
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:39,740
born into the world, war babies. will they
ever have peace?

1
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,039
here's our briefing on some of the key events
happening later.

1
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,490
we begin in seoul where the world anti-doping
agency has just decided to maintain its suspension

1
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,490
of russia.

1
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:56,950
the agency will give more details about it
at 7 gmt. then around midday in london the

1
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,080
chairman of the old vic theatre will give
a briefing on the findings of the investigation

1
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,759
into allegations concerning the conduct of
kevin spacey during his tenure as artistic

1
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,640
director.

1
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,720
and later on in germany it's the deadline
for germany's political parties to agree how

1
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,308
to form the basis of a new coalition in the
wake of septembers inconclusive elections.

1
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:23,638
sport, now and peru have claimed

1
00:21:23,638 --> 00:21:27,709
the 32nd and final place at next year's world
cup in russia.

1
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,160
they've beaten new zealand 2-0, in lima, in
the second leg of their intercontinental playoff,

1
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,420
and also 2-0 on aggregate.

1
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,620
jefferson farfan and christian ramos scored
the goals, as peru qualified for the world

1
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:46,619
cup for the first time since 1982. earlier,
australia beat honduras 3-1 in sydney to reach

1
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:52,349
their fourth successive world cup finals.
and now here's the rest of today's sport briefing

1
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:56,469
with sarah mulkerrins.

1
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,308
hello i'm sarah mulkerrins with your sport
briefing for thursday.

1
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:04,058
roger federer is already through to the last
four at the atp finals in london, but can

1
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:08,148
he keep up his winning ways against marin
cilic later? and we'll tell you about the

1
00:22:08,148 --> 00:22:19,079
iranian weight lifter putting his olympic
gold medal up for auction.

1
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:22,788
roger federer is the strong favourite to finish
2017

1
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:24,589
the way he started it - by winning.

1
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:30,048
the world number two faces marin cilic later
in his last group match, as he aims for yet

1
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,000
another atp finals title.

1
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,619
he's already through to the semi-finals on
saturday and, if he wins the tournament, it

1
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,288
would be his 96th career title.

1
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:44,609
alexander zverev has a long way to go to match
that record - the german plays jack sock in

1
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:51,609
thursday's other match, with a place in the
last four for the winner of that.

1
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:56,589
europe's top golfer for the year will be decided
over the weekend as the race to dubai reaches

1
00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:00,740
it's climax. and there's three players firmly
in the hunt.

1
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,519
england's tommy fleetwood and justin rose
are the leading contenders, although masters

1
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,929
champion, sergio garcia, could pip both of
them to the title if he wins the season-ending

1
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,960
dubai world championship, which gets underway
on thursday.

1
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,269
no matter what position you are in,

1
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:21,289
you are starting off with the guys you are
starting off with the guys you have around

1
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:25,178
so it is great for people to watch.

1
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,929
i will enjoy the challenge.

1
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:33,519
it is a bit of a dogfight towards the end
of the year and i am looking forward to it..

1
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,349
nba fans are in for a real treat later, the
best of the west will face the leaders in

1
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:44,639
the east, as golden state warriors take on
the boston celtics. and the celtics are on

1
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,230
a roll, their win over the brooklyn nets,
on tuesday was their 13th in a row.

1
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,929
boston have won more nba championships than
any other team but you have to go back to

1
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:10,149
2008 when they last came out on top. in case
you missed it, if you're a rugby union fan

1
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:15,789
and really organised, well, you can start
planning your trip for the 2023 world cup.

1
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:20,849
this was one of the surprise stories on wednesday,
as france was announced as the host.

1
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:22,399
not many saw it coming,

1
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,730
as south africa were expected to win the vote
after an independent review recommended they

1
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,960
stage the tournament.

1
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,620
ireland also missed out, as world rugby president,
bill beaumont, declared france as hosts after

1
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:38,699
a secret ballot by the council in london.

1
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:45,519
it probably won't come as a huge surprise
to hear that italy manager, gian piero ventura,

1
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,679
has been sacked.

1
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,519
it follows their failure to qualify for the
world cup.

1
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:56,130
a 1-0 aggregate defeat to sweden on monday
sealed italy's fate - meaning they won't play

1
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:02,399
on football's biggest stage for the first
time since 1958. and, after being given his

1
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:08,168
marching orders, ventura complained that he

1
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:19,559

1
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:13,700
for many of us it is going to be another pretty
cloudy start to the day on thursday, but there

1
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,038
will be some significant weather changes,
because this cold front is going to be sliding

1
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,740
its way southwards as we go on

1
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,308
through the day and behind that we're going
to see the skies turning much brighter with

1
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:25,509
much more in the way of sunshine.

1
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:30,410
early on thursday, but whether around scotland.

1
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:38,580
a cloudy start to the day the many and fog
patches for some.

1
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:41,139
it is an improving weather picture as we go
through the day.

1
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,169
the land of rain chased by much sunnier skies.

1
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,240
the rain and moving away from northern ireland
and heading into wales where the rain can

1
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,888
still be quite heavy.

1
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:59,349
some gaps in the cloud, maybe a few sunny
spells across south-west england and the midlands

1
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:04,579
but for east anglia and south-east england,
a great and missed the start to the day with

1
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:10,648

a few spots of rain in the north-west.

1
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:39,250
not much left on it by the time it reaches
london. in the sunnier skies, down goes the

1
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,339
temperatures.

1
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:46,500
then, thursday evening, the rain clears away
from south-east england.

1
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,200

of sunshine.
